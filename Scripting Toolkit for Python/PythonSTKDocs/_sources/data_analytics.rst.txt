Data Analytics Example Notebooks
================================


These examples show how to use the MI Scripting Toolkit to perform some common data analytics tasks, including statistical roll-ups and generation of plots. All examples use the MI Training database, available from the Ansys Download Center or the Download Software page on `the Granta MI Support site <https://grantadesign.com/industry/support/granta-mi>`_ . Most examples also require the use of additional dependencies outside of the MI Scripting Toolkit, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
