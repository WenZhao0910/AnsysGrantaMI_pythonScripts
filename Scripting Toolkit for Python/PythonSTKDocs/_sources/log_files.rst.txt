Logging
*******

In MI Scripting Toolkit v2.1 and later, Python messages are no longer logged to a file by default. Configuration of logging is best handled by the application developer, who knows their target audience and what handlers are most appropriate for their application.  For comprehensive Python logging capabilities, we recommend using the Python 'logging' module. 

A new Helper Function (``log_to_file_in_local_app_data``) can be used to output a log file in the Streamlined API when one is required for troubleshooting.

Note that the underlying C libraries in the MI Scripting Toolkit will still perform their own logging, which can be found in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Granta Design\\MIScriptingToolkit` (or the Linux equivalent), but this is independent of Python logging.
