What's new in Version 2.3
*************************

Key features introduced or improved in MI Scripting Toolkit 2.3.

Streamlined API enhancements and bug fixes
==========================================

Extended platform support
-------------------------
MI Scripting Toolkit now supports autologin for Linux installs, and can be installed on SUSE Enterprise 15. This release has also been certified on Cygwin 3.1.7-1.

New and expanded Example Notebooks
----------------------------------
The Streamlined API examples now cover more functionality, including examples of more attribute data types and searches, and new scripts added for OpenID Connect authentication and the asynchronous Job Queue.

Integration with new MI import services
---------------------------------------
Create asynchronous import jobs and interact with the Job Queue via the MI Scripting Toolkit.

Fetch records linked via tabular data
-------------------------------------
Use Association Chains to find and fetch linked records, with the ability to specify a chain or the link direction.


Bug fixes and feature requests
------------------------------

* Functional data attributes now support optional parameters (empty values or columns in functional data objects).
* Pseudo-attribute subsets now fully supported by the MI Scripting Toolkit.
* Users can now check whether an attribute is single- or multi-valued; previously this was only flagged by an exception raised when updating the record on the server.
* Binary data stored in File and Picture attributes is now accessible through the ``binary_data`` property, meaning files can be loaded from memory as well as from a file on disk.
* Hyperlink attributes have accessible and settable display type and description properties.
* Support added for Not Applicable attributes (``isApplicable`` flag can be set through the MI Scripting Toolkit).
* ``Record.all_children()`` now returns a list of records, rather than a ``TreeIterator`` object.

Foundation API enhancements and bug fixes
=========================================

* Examples now only use the MI Training database. 
* ``LookupValue`` added to ``RecordReference`` to support exact short-text attribute searches.
* Support for pseudo-attribute subsets added.
* ``GetAssociatedRecords`` response and request added to support association chains.


Backwards incompatible API changes
==================================
We recommend changing scripts using ``File`` or ``Picture`` objects in preparation for a pending deprecation, described in the Version 2.2 section of the :ref:`upgrading` page.

Version 2.2 scripts should work without modification.

Version 2.1 scripts should work without modification.

Version 2.0 scripts may need to be modified to account for breaking changes identified in the Version 2.0 section of the :ref:`upgrading` page.
