    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook provides some tips and tricks on improving the performance of the Streamlined API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Streamlined API is a productivity layer that wraps the Foundation Layer. It typically loads a lot of information for the user in anticipation that the user will need it, which  makes exploratory work in interactive sessions (such as in Jupyter Notebooks) very powerful as a tool. The examples below show some coding approaches that may improve the speed and performance of your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution times for some of the functions are shown, however, note that performance depends fundamentally on your hardware setup and connection speed, and on previously-executed code in the same Notebook, amongst other factors. We cannot guarantee that the saved outputs in this Notebook will match what you will see, and they are intended primarily as a guide rather than a benchmark."

    "## Establishing a Session\n",
    "\n",
    "The first steps in any MI Scripting Toolkit script are to make a connection to a Granta MI Service Layer, then fetch a database and table. The three objects, and the fastest ways of acquiring them, are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Session` - `mpy.connect()` is the fastest way to create a session.\n",
    "2. `Database` - `Session.get_db()` is the fastest way to fetch a database\n",
    "3. `Table` - `Database.get_table()` is the fastest way to fetch a table\n",
    "\n",
    "`get_db` and `get_table`, however, actually fetch *all* the databases and *all* the tables (for the selected database) and just return the one that was asked for. The results are then cached; this means those calls to the Service Layer will not be repeated when the objects are accessed again. You can see the effect of this when re-running the cell below multiple times."

    "There are many search methods in the Streamlined API and all of them make a single Service Layer call when executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, some methods that get records from a table and also populate caches which can be useful. For example, if you have some very specific filtering that you want to apply to all records that cannot be found using the existing functionality, such as a list of all records with 3 or more children. In this case, you could use `Table.all_records()` to return a list of all records in the table and populate the children of each record, in one call. You would then apply your own search filters to the record list to execute a search."
