J	Dura, Jose L.; Solanes, Carmen; De Andres, Jose; Saiz, Javier								Effect of Lead Position and Polarity on Paresthesia Coverage in Spinal Cord Stimulation Therapy: A Computational Study								NEUROMODULATION				25	5			680	692		10.1016/j.neurom.2021.12.013				JUL 2022	2022	Objectives: The effect of lead placement and programming strategies on spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy has been widely studied; however, there is a need to optimize these parameters to favor dorsal column (DC) over dorsal root (DR) stimulation in complex pain treatment. This study aimed to determine the optimal lateral distance between two leads and the effect of transverse stimulation using a mathematical model. Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional computational SCS and a nerve fiber model were used to determine the effect of the lateral distance between two leads at the same vertebral level T8 and the effect of the addition of anodes with two parallel leads at T8 and three different lateral distances on the model-based results (perception thresholds, activated DC fiber area and depth, and position of the first stimulated fiber). Results: With two parallel leads programmed with symmetrical polarities, the maximal DC fiber area stimulated was found for a lateral distance of 5 mm. The results also show a higher preference for DR stimulation as the lateral distance increased. The addition of positive contacts at the same level of active contacts in the second lead produces a displacement of the first stimulated fiber laterally. Conclusions: A lateral distance of 5 mm shows a DC stimulated fiber area greater than when leads are placed contiguously. The addition of anodes creates an effect whereby the area of paresthesia is not displaced to the midline, but in the opposite direction. This may be useful when the leads are too close and stimulation of one of the sides is compromised.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000824610200004	35131153

Multiscale Computer Model of the Spinal Dorsal Horn Reveals Changes in Network Processing Associated with Chronic Pain								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE				42	15			3133	3149		10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1199-21.2022				APR 13 2022	2022	Pain-related sensory input is processed in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) before being relayed to the brain. That processing profoundly influences whether stimuli are correctly or incorrectly perceived as painful. Significant advances have been made in identifying the types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that comprise the SDH, and there is some information about how neuron types are con-nected, but it remains unclear how the overall circuit processes sensory input or how that processing is disrupted under chronic pain conditions. To explore SDH function, we developed a computational model of the circuit that is tightly constrained by experimental data. Our model comprises conductance-based neuron models that reproduce the characteristic firing patterns of spinal neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, defined by their expression of genetic markers, spiking pattern, or morphology, were synaptically connected according to available qualitative data. Using a genetic algorithm, synaptic weights were tuned to reproduce projection neuron firing rates (model output) based on primary afferent firing rates (model input) across a range of mechanical stim-ulus intensities. Disparate synaptic weight combinations could produce equivalent circuit function, revealing degeneracy that may underlie heterogeneous responses of different circuits to perturbations or pathologic insults. To validate our model, we verified that it responded to the reduction of inhibition (i.e., disinhibition) and ablation of specific neuron types in a manner consistent with experi-ments. Thus validated, our model offers a valuable resource for interpreting experimental results and testing hypotheses in silico to plan experiments for examining normal and pathologic SDH circuit function.																		0270-6474	1529-2401		WOS:000789016600006	35232767

J	Rogers, Evan R.; Zander, Hans J.; Lempka, Scott F.								Neural Recruitment During Conventional, Burst, and 10-kHz Spinal Cord Stimulation for Pain								JOURNAL OF PAIN				23	3			434	449		10.1016/j.jpain.2021.09.005				MAR 2022	2022	Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a popular neurostimulation therapy for severe chronic pain. To improve stimulation efficacy, multiple modes are now used clinically, including conventional, burst, and 10-kHz SCS. Clinical observations have produced speculation that these modes target different neural elements and/or work via distinct mechanisms of action. However, in humans, these hypotheses cannot be conclusively answered via experimental methods. Therefore, we utilized computational modeling to assess the response of primary afferents, interneurons, and projection neurons to conventional, burst, and 10-kHz SCS. We found that local cell thresholds were always higher than afferent thresholds, arguing against direct recruitment of these local cells. Furthermore, although we observed relative threshold differences between conventional, burst, and 10-kHz SCS, the recruitment order was the same. Finally, contrary to previous reports, axon collateralization produced complex changes in activation thresholds of primary afferents. These results motivate future work to contextualize clinical observations across SCS paradigms.Perspective: This article presents the first computational modeling study to investigate neural recruitment during conventional, burst, and 10-kilohertz spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain within a single modeling framework. The results provide insight into these treatments' unknown mechanisms of action and offer context to interpreting clinical observations.

Rats subjected to the spared nerve injury model (SNI) and implanted with a SCS lead were assigned to DTMP or LR and stimulated for 48 h. A No-SCS group received no stimulation, and a Sham group received no SNI or stimulation. Proteins in the dorsal ipsilateral quadrant of the stimulated SC were identified and quantified using mass spectrometry. Proteins significantly modulated by DTMP or LR relative to No-SCS were identified. Bioinformatic tools were used to identify proteins related to ion transport regulation. DTMP modulated a larger number of proteins than LR. More than 40 proteins significantly involved in the regulation of chloride (Cl-), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), or calcium (Ca2+) ions were identified. SNI affected proteins that promote the increase of intracellular Ca2+, Na+, and K+ and decrease of intracellular Cl-. DTMP modulated proteins involved in glial response to neural injury that affect Ca2+ signaling. DTMP decreased levels of proteins related to Ca2+ transport that may result in the reduction of intracellular Ca2+. Presynaptic proteins involved in GABA vesicle formation and release were upregulated by DTMP. DTMP also upregulated postsynaptic proteins involved with elevated intracellular Cl-, while modulating proteins, expressed by astrocytes, that regulate postsynaptic Cl- inhibition. DTMP downregulated K+ regulatory proteins affected by SNI that affect neuronal depolarization, and upregulated proteins that are associated with a decrease of intracellular neuronal K+ and astrocyte uptake of extracellular K+. DTMP treatment modulated the expression of proteins with the potential to facilitate a reversal of dysregulation of ion transport and signaling associated with a model of neuropathic pain.																			1744-8069		WOS:000748470400001	35048719

Pilot study on the effects of low intensity focused ultrasound in a swine model of neuropathic pain								JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY				135	5			1508	1515		10.3171/2020.9.JNS202962				NOV 2021	2021	OBJECTIVE The authors' laboratory has previously demonstrated beneficial effects of noninvasive low intensity focused ultrasound (liFUS), targeted at the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), for reducing allodynia in rodent neuropathic pain models. However, in rats the DRG is 5 mm below the skin when approached laterally, while in humans the DRG is typically 5- 8 cm deep. Here, using a modified liFUS probe, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of using external liFUS for modulation of antinociceptive responses in neuropathic swine.METHODS Two cohorts of swine underwent a common peroneal nerve injury (CPNI) to induce neuropathic pain. In the first cohort, pigs (14 kg) were iteratively tested to determine treatment parameters. liFUS penetration to the L5 DRG was verified by using a thermocouple to monitor tissue temperature changes and by measuring nerve conduction velocity (NCV) at the corresponding common peroneal nerve (CPN). Pain behaviors were monitored before and after treatment. DRG was evaluated for tissue damage postmortem. Based on data from the first cohort, a treatment algorithm was developed, parameter predictions were verified, and neuropathic pain was significantly modified in a second cohort of larger swine (20 kg).RESULTS The authors performed a dose-response curve analysis in 14- kg CPNI swine. Specifically, after confirming that the liFUS probe could reach 5 cm in ex vivo tissue experiments, the authors tested liFUS in 14-kg CPNI swine. The mean +/- SEM DRG depth was 3.79 +/- 0.09 cm in this initial cohort. The parameters were determined and then extrapolated to larger animals (20 kg), and predictions were verified. Tissue temperature elevations at the treatment site did not exceed 2 degrees C, and the expected increases in the CPN NCV were observed. liFUS treatment eliminated pain guarding in all animals for the duration of follow-up (up to 1 month) and improved allodynia for 5 days postprocedure. No evidence of histological damage was seen using Fluoro-Jade and H&E staining.CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate that a 5-cm depth can be reached with external liFUS and alters pain behavior and allodynia in a large-animal model of neuropathic pain.																		0022-3085	1933-0693		WOS:000714987200001	33862597	
J	Zhong, Yihua; Wang, Jicheng; Beckel, Jonathan; de Groat, William C.; Tai, Changfeng								Model Analysis of Post-Stimulation Effect on Axonal Conduction and Block								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING				68	10			2974	2985		10.1109/TBME.2021.3057522				OCT 2021	2021	Objective: To reveal the possible contribution of changes in membrane ion concentration gradients and ion pump activity to axonal conduction/block induced by long-duration electrical stimulation. Methods: A new model for conduction and block of unmyelinated axons based on the classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) equations is developed to include changes in Na+ and K+ concentrations and ion pumps. The effect of long-duration stimulation on axonal conduction/block is analyzed by computer simulation using this new model. Results: The new model successfully simulates initiation, propagation, and block of action potentials induced by short-duration (multiple milliseconds) stimulations that do not significantly change the ion concentrations in the classical HH model. In addition, the activity-dependent effects such as action potential attenuation and broadening observed in animal studies are also successfully simulated by the new model. Finally, the model successfully simulates axonal block occurring after terminating a long-duration (multiple seconds) direct current (DC) stimulation as observed in recent animal studies and reveals 3 different mechanisms for the post-DC block of axonal conduction. Conclusion: Ion concentrations and pumps play an important role in post-stimulation effects and activity-dependent effects on axonal conduction/block. The duration of stimulation is a determinant factor because it influences the total charges applied to the axon, which in turn determines the ion concentrations inside and outside the axon. Significance: Despite recent clinical success of many neurostimulation therapies, the effects of long-duration stimulation on axonal conduction/block are poorly understood. This new model could significantly impact our understanding of the mechanisms underlying different neurostimulation therapies.																		0018-9294	1558-2531		WOS:000697820800013	33544668

Neuromodulation using ultra low frequency current waveform reversibly blocks axonal conduction and chronic pain								SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE				13	608					eabg9890	10.1126/scitranslmed.abg9890				AUG 25 2021	2021	Chronic pain remains a leading cause of disability worldwide, and there is still a clinical reliance on opioids despite the medical side effects associated with their use and societal impacts associated with their abuse. An alternative approach is the use of electrical neuromodulation to produce analgesia. Direct current can block action potential propagation but leads to tissue damage if maintained. We have developed a form of ultra low frequency (ULF) biphasic current and studied its effects. In anesthetized rats, this waveform produced a rapidly developing and completely reversible conduction block in >85% of spinal sensory nerve fibers excited by peripheral stimulation. Sustained ULF currents at lower amplitudes led to a slower onset but reversible conduction block. Similar changes were seen in an animal model of neuropathic pain, where ULF waveforms blocked sensory neuron ectopic activity, known to be an important driver of clinical neuropathic pain. Using a computational model, we showed that prolonged ULF currents could induce accumulation of extracellular potassium, accounting for the slowly developing block observed in rats. Last, we tested the analgesic effects of epidural ULF currents in 20 subjects with chronic leg and back pain. Pain ratings improved by 90% after 2 weeks. One week after explanting the electrodes, pain ratings reverted to 72% of pretreatment screening value. We conclude that epidural spinal ULF neuromodulation represents a promising therapy for treating chronic pain.																		1946-6234	1946-6242		WOS:000689723700006	34433642	
J	Jiao, Jiao; Wang, Feng; Huang, Jie-Jie; Huang, Jin-Jian; Li, Zong-An; Kong, Yan; Zhang, Zhi-Jun								Microfluidic hollow fiber with improved stiffness repairs peripheral nerve injury through non-invasive electromagnetic induction and controlled release of NGF								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				426						131826	10.1016/j.cej.2021.131826		AUG 2021		DEC 15 2021	2021	Peripheral nerve injury can lead to paralysis, chronic pain, muscle atrophy and disability due to interrupted bioelectric signal communications between spinal cord and the innervated bodies. Bioelectric materials, particularly conductive hydrogels, have shown the increasing potentials in neural engineering because they serve as tissue scaffolds that can support cell growth and differentiation, and restore functional electric conduction. In this work, we fabricated size-tunable microfluidic hollow fibers (HF) with improved stiffness and elasticity based on a triple network called SCPAPPy, which was composed of sodium alginate/Ca2+ (SC), polyacrylamide (PA), and polypyrrole (PPy). This HF showed a higher conductivity of 0.32 S/m than that of native sciatic nerve. Based on finite element analysis and digital oscilloscope measurement, the conductive HF was demonstrated to generate electromotive forces through electromagnetic induction by using a figure-eight coil. This creative approach could non-invasively facilitate myelination by improving Schwann cell's growth and migration. Meanwhile, the electromotive forces drove the secretion of endogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) from Schwann cells. Moreover, exogenous nerve growth factor-75 (NGF-75) was loaded in the HF, which was released gradually and promoted the differentiation of neurons in a controlled manner. By applying the pulsed magnetic field (MF) and NGF-75 together, it was found that the rats with 5-mm sciatic nerve defects achieved a more rapid nerve regeneration and functional recovery. In a word, our study demonstrated the practical role of electromagnetic induction on nerve repair, and opened the window of synergistic therapy combining the bioelectricity and neurotrophic factors towards peripheral nerve injury.																		1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724596700003

The effect of neuropathic pain medication use on SCS outcome is poorly understood.OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of gabapentinoid use on SCS outcome measured by trial success, explantation rate and opioid dose reduction during a 2-yr follow-up.METHODS: The study cohort included 203 consecutive FBSS patients who underwent SCS in a single tertiary center during January 1997 to March 2014. Purchase data of gabapentinoids, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, and benzodiazepines during January 1995 to March 2016 were retrieved from national registries.RESULTS: In multivariate Cox regression analysis, patients using gabapentinoids had significantly fewer explantations during the 2-yr follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] 0.2, 95% CI 0.04-0.81, P = .03). In contrast, patients with opioid use of >40 morphine milligram equivalent before implantation had significantly more explantations (HR 6.7, 95% CI 2.5-18, P < .01). In bivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for patient specific factors, year of SCS implantation, use of neuropathic pain medication, opioids, and benzodiazepines, patients using gabapentinoids significantly more often discontinued opioids or reduced their dose by more than 50% during the 2-yr follow-up (odds ratio 5.7, 95% CI 1.4-23, P = .015).CONCLUSION: The use of gabapentinoids was associated with a significantly lower spinal cord stimulator explantation rate and a higher chance of opioid discontinuation or >50% dose reduction. This indicates that patients with SCS could benefit from concomitant use of gabapentinoids. Prospective randomized trials are warranted to verify this hypothesis.																		0148-396X	1524-4040		WOS:000700084500036	34270731

Minerva medica											10.23736/S0026-4806.21.07588-1				2021-Jul-16	2021	BACKGROUND: Electrical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an alternative to conventional medication for chronic pain relief. Several hypotheses exist concerning the neurophysiological, vascular, and neurochemical mechanism behind SCS.METHODS: The excitation and blockade effects of the three common SCS waveforms (tonic, burst, and high-frequency stimulation) on the nerve fibers bypassing the region of the electrodes are analyzed in a computational study. The simulations are based on the model of Hodgkin and Huxley which is fitted to spike durations of 1 ms.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: SCS is FDA approved technique for pain relief but the mechanisms of action are still under investigation. The first element in the chain of mechanisms is the generation and the block of spikes in nerve fibers close to the stimulating electrode. For these 'primary fibers' computer simulations showed that conventional SCS generates sharply synchronized spikes whereas the spread of the spiking times by burst stimulation is expected to cause the suppression of paresthesia. This rather uniform spread of spiking times (in comparison to tonic stimulation) is a consequence of more pulses (5 vs. 1), longer pulses, and increasing intensities within each train of 5 pulses. High-frequency stimulation can block the conduction of spikes but the distance of the fiber to the lead is a critical factor.																			1827-1669		MEDLINE:34269551	34269551

Low back pain								LANCET				398	10294			78	92		10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00733-9		JUL 2021		JUL 3 2021	2021	Low back pain covers a spectrum of different types of pain (eg, nociceptive, neuropathic and nociplastic, or non-specific) that frequently overlap. The elements comprising the lumbar spine (eg, soft tissue, vertebrae, zygapophyseal and sacroiliac joints, intervertebral discs, and neurovascular structures) are prone to different stressors, and each of these, alone or in combination, can contribute to low back pain. Due to numerous factors related to low back pain, and the low specificity of imaging and diagnostic injections, diagnostic methods for this condition continue to be a subject of controversy. The biopsychosocial model posits low back pain to be a dynamic interaction between social, psychological, and biological factors that can both predispose to and result from injury, and should be considered when devising interdisciplinary treatment plans. Prevention of low back pain is recognised as a pivotal challenge in high-risk populations to help tackle high health-care costs related to therapy and rehabilitation. To a large extent, therapy depends on pain classification, and usually starts with self-care and pharmacotherapy in combination with non-pharmacological methods, such as physical therapies and psychological treatments in appropriate patients. For refractory low back pain, a wide range of non-surgical (eg, epidural steroid injections and spinal cord stimulation for neuropathic pain, and radiofrequency ablation and intra-articular steroid injections for mechanical pain) and surgical (eg, decompression for neuropathic pain, disc replacement, and fusion for mechanical causes) treatment options are available in carefully selected patients. Most treatment options address only single, solitary causes and given the complex nature of low back pain, a multimodal interdisciplinary approach is necessary. Although globally recognised as an important health and socioeconomic challenge with an expected increase in prevalence, low back pain continues to have tremendous potential for improvement in both diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. Future research on low back pain should focus on improving the accuracy and objectivity of diagnostic assessments, and devising treatment algorithms that consider unique biological, psychological, and social factors. High-quality comparative-effectiveness and randomised controlled trials with longer follow-up periods that aim to establish the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of low back pain management are warranted.																		0140-6736	1474-547X		WOS:000668969500031	34115979	
J	Koenig, Christian; Vazquez, Enrique; Ess, Sabrina; Ebbinghaus, Matthias; Vorpahl, Bjoern; Ebersberger, Andrea; Schaible, Hans-Georg								Spinal interleukin-1 beta induces mechanical spinal hyperexcitability in rats: Interactions and redundancies with TNF and IL-6								JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY				158	4			898	911		10.1111/jnc.15438		JUN 2021		AUG 2021	2021	Both spinal tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contribute to the development of "mechanical" spinal hyperexcitability in inflammatory pain states. Recently, we found that spinal sensitization by TNF was significantly reduced by blockade of spinal IL-6 signaling suggesting that IL-6 signaling is involved in spinal TNF effects. Here, we explored whether spinal interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), also implicated in inflammatory pain, induces "mechanical" spinal hyperexcitability, and whether spinal IL-1 beta effects are related to TNF and IL-6 effects. We recorded the responses of spinal cord neurons to mechanical stimulation of the knee joint in vivo and used cellular approaches on microglial and astroglial cell lines to identify interactions of IL-1 beta, TNF, and IL-6. Spinal application of IL-1 beta in anesthetized rats modestly enhanced responses of spinal cord neurons to innocuous and noxious mechanical joint stimulation. This effect was blocked by minocycline indicating microglia involvement, and significantly attenuated by interfering with IL-6 signaling. In the BV2 microglial cell line, IL-1 beta, like TNF, enhanced the release of soluble IL-6 receptor, necessary for spinal IL-6 actions. Different to TNF, IL-1 beta caused SNB-19 astrocytes to release interleukin-11. The generation of "mechanical" spinal hyperexcitability by IL-1 beta was more pronounced upon spinal TNF neutralization with etanercept, suggesting that concomitant TNF limits IL-1 beta effects. In BV2 cells, TNF stimulated the release of IL-1Ra, an endogenous IL-1 beta antagonist. Thus, spinal IL-1 beta has the potential to induce spinal hyperexcitability sharing with TNF dependency on IL-6 signaling, but TNF also limited IL-1 beta effects explaining the modest effect of IL-1 beta.																		0022-3042	1471-4159		WOS:000667505600001	34050952

Methods Sprague-Dawley adult male rats (n =36) were randomly assigned into control, DPN, and EA groups (n=12 each). After four weeks of EA treatment, response to mechanical pain and fasting blood glucose were analyzed. A tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling approach coupled with liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify potential biomarkers in the spinal dorsal horn. Further, proteomics analysis was used to quantify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), and gene ontology, KEGG pathways, cluster, and string protein network interaction analyses conducted to explore the main protein targets of EA. Results Compared with the DPN model group, the mechanical pain threshold was significantly increased, while the fasting blood glucose levels were clearly decreased in EA group rats. Proteomics analysis was used to quantify 5393 proteins, and DEPs were chosen for further analyses, based on a threshold of 1.2-fold difference in expression level (P < 0.05) compared with control groups. Relative to the control group, 169 down-regulated and 474 up-regulated proteins were identified in the DPN group, while 107 and 328 proteins were up- and down-regulated in the EA treatment group compared with the DPN group. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that levels of proteins involved in oxidative stress injury regulation were dramatically altered during the EA effects on DPN. Conclusions Our results provide the valuable protein biomarkers, which facilitates unique mechanistic insights into the DPN pathogenesis and EA analgesic, antioxidant stress and hypoglycemic effect.																		1664-2392			WOS:000665186900001	34177794	
J	Solanes, Carmen; Dura, Jose L.; Angeles Canos, M.; De Andres, Jose; Marti-Bonmati, Luis; Saiz, Javier								3D patient-specific spinal cord computational model for SCS management: potential clinical applications								JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING				18	3					036017	10.1088/1741-2552/abe44f				JUN 2021	2021	Objective. Although spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established therapy for treating neuropathic chronic pain, in tonic stimulation, postural changes, electrode migration or badly-positioned electrodes can produce annoying stimulation (intercostal neuralgia) in about 35% of the patients. SCS models are used to study the effect of electrical stimulation to better manage the stimulation parameters and electrode position. The goal of this work was to develop a realistic 3D patient-specific spinal cord model from a real patient and develop a future clinical application that would help physicians to optimize paresthesia coverage in SCS therapy. Approach. We developed two 3D patient-specific models from a high-resolution MRI of two patients undergoing SCS treatment. The model consisted of a finite element model of the spinal cord and a sensory myelinated nerve fiber model. The same simulations were performed with a generalized spinal cord model and we compared the results with the clinical data to evaluate the advantages of a patient-specific model. To identify the geometrical parameters that most influence the stimulation predictions, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. We used the patient-specific model to perform a clinical application involving the pre-implantation selection of electrode polarity and study the effect of electrode offset. Main results. The patient-specific model correlated better with clinical data than the generalized model. Electrode-dura mater distance, dorsal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) thickness, and CSF diameter are the geometrical parameters that caused significant changes in the stimulation predictions. Electrode polarity could be planned and optimized to stimulate the patient's painful dermatomes. The addition of offset in parallel electrodes would not have been beneficial for one of the patients of this study because they reduce neural activation displacement. Significance. This is the first study to relate the activation area model prediction in dorsal columns with the clinical effect on paresthesia coverage. The outcomes show that 3D patient-specific models would help physicians to choose the best stimulation parameters to optimize neural activation and SCS therapy in tonic stimulation.																		1741-2560	1741-2552		WOS:000629554700001	33556926

To avoid the under and over stimulation caused by lead migration, evoked compound action potentials (ECAP) is used as feedback signal to change the stimulating parameters. This study established a simulation model of ECAP recording to investigate the relationship between ECAP component and dorsal column (DC) fiber recruitment. Finite element model of SCS and multi-compartment model of sensory fiber were coupled to calculate the single fiber action potential (SFAP) caused by single fiber in different spinal cord regions. The synthetized ECAP, superimposition of SFAP, could be considered as an index of DC fiber excitation degree, because the position of crests and amplitude of ECAP corresponds to different fiber diameters. When 10% or less DC fibers were excited, the crests corresponded to fibers with large diameters. When 20% or more DC fibers were excited, ECAP showed a slow conduction crest, which corresponded to fibers with small diameters. The amplitude of this slow conduction crest increased as the stimulating intensity increased while the amplitude of the fast conduction crest almost remained unchanged. Therefore, the simulated ECAP signal in this paper could be used to evaluate the degree of excitation of DC fibers. This SCS-ECAP model may provide theoretical basis for future clinical application of close loop SCS base on ECAP.脊髓电刺激（SCS）治疗慢性疼痛以一种开环的方式植入，植入后刺激参数一般保持不变。为了避免电极位置变化引起刺激强度不足或过度刺激，可以利用 SCS 电极记录的诱发复合动作电位（ECAP）作为反馈信号，来调整刺激参数。本文建立了 SCS 同步记录 ECAP 的仿真模型，并研究 ECAP 波形与脊髓背侧柱（DC）纤维兴奋程度之间的关系。通过 SCS 有限元仿真模型和感觉纤维多房室电缆模型的耦合计算 SCS 作用下由膜电流引起的单纤维动作电位（SFAP），将 SFAP 叠加获得电极上记录的差分形式的 ECAP 信号。仿真结果表明 ECAP 中不同的波谷对应着不同直径的感觉纤维，由波谷位置和幅值可以判断 DC 纤维兴奋程度。不超过 10% DC 纤维兴奋时的 ECAP 波谷对应着大直径感觉纤维，20% 及以上 DC 纤维兴奋时出现慢传导的波谷，对应着小直径感觉纤维，且 DC 纤维兴奋程度越高，波谷幅值越大，但大直径纤维对应的波谷幅值保持不变。本文建立的 SCS 同步采集 ECAP 仿真模型可以模拟 ECAP 信号并由波谷位置和幅度判断 DC 纤维兴奋程度，进而判定刺激强度过小、适当或过大，为基于 ECAP 的闭环 SCS 在未来的临床应用提供理论依据。.																		1001-5515			MEDLINE:33913282	33913282	
J	Li, Zhi-Xiao; Li, Yu-Juan; Wang, Qian; He, Zhi-Gang; Feng, Mao-Hui; Xiang, Hong-Bing								Characterization of novel lncRNAs in upper thoracic spinal cords of rats with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injuries								EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE				21	4					352	10.3892/etm.2021.9783				APR 2021	2021	Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a significant problem in clinical cardiology, and refers to a more serious myocardial injury caused by blood recanalization after a period of myocardial ischemia, as compared with injury caused by vascular occlusion. The spinal cord, as the primary afferent and efferent center of cardiac sensory and sympathetic nerve fibres, has received increased attention in recent years with regards to the regulation of MIRIs. Previous studies have revealed that MIRI has a strong correlation with the abnormal expression of long non-coding (lnc)RNAs in the myocardium; however, there are limited reports on the effects of the altered expression of lncRNAs in the spinal cord following MIRI. To investigate the expression patterns of lncRNAs in the spinal cord after MIRI and their potential role in the early stage of reperfusion, a MIRI model was established in rats. After 30 min of myocardial ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion, the upper thoracic spinal cord tissues were immediately dissected and isolated. lncRNAs and mRNAs in spinal cord tissues were screened using transcriptome sequencing technology, and the expression of several highly deregulated mRNAs, including Frs3, Zfp52, Dnajc6, Nedd4l, Tep1, Myef2, Tgfbr1, Fgf12, Mef2c, Tfdp1 and lncRNA, including ENSRNOT00000080713, ENSRNOT00000090564, ENSRNOT00000082588, ENSRNOT00000091080, ENSRNOT00000091570, ENSRNOT00000087777, ENSRNOT00000082061, ENSRNOT00000091108, ENSRNOT00000087028, ENSRNOT00000086475, were further validated via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The number of altered expressed lncRNAs was 126, among which there were 41 upregulated probe sets and 85 downregulated sets. A total of 470 mRNAs were differentially expressed, in which 231 probe sets were upregulated and 239 were downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that dysregulated transcripts related to biological processes were mainly associated with 'cell-cell signaling'. Moreover, pathway analysis demonstrated significant changes in the 'PI3K/Akt signaling pathway' and the 'p53 signaling pathway'. Thus, the altered expression of lncRNAs in the spinal cord may be of considerable importance in the process of MIRI. The present results could provide an insight into the potential roles and mechanism of lncRNAs during the early stage of reperfusion.																		1792-0981	1792-1015		WOS:000621536700001	33732325

Based on what is known in the pain field, a heuristic model can be proposed for the pathophysiolgy of tinnitus. This heuristic pathophysiological model suggests that pain and tinnitus are the consequence of an imbalance between two pain/tinnitus evoking pathways, i.e., a lateral sensory pathway and a medial affective pathway, both of which are not balanced anymore by a pain/noise inhibitory pathway. Mechanistically, based on the Bayesian brain concept, it can be explained by a switch occuring under influence of the rostral to dorsal anterior cingulate cortex of its prior predictions, i.e., a reference resetting, in which the pain/tinnitus state is considered as the new reference state. This reference resetting is confirmed by the nucleus accumbens as part of the reward system and maintained by connectivity changes between the nucleus accumbens and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. As a consequence it can be suggested to treat pain/tinnitus via reconditioning, either surgically or non-surgically. The model can also be used to develop objective measures for tinnitus and pain via supervised machine learning.																		0079-6123		978-0-12-822375-8	WOS:000752577900016	33931186

IEEE					Influence of Morphology and Waveform Parameters on the Neural Response to Spinal Cord Stimulation								2021 10TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)		International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering						259	262		10.1109/NER49283.2021.9441267				2021	2021	Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a neurostimulation treatment for patients suffering from refractory chronic pain. Thousands of SCS systems are implanted annually, yet its success rate remains suboptimal, largely because its therapeutic mechanisms of action are not well understood. The direct effects of SCS - i.e., which neuronal elements are activated directly by the electrical currents produced by SCS systems - remain unclear, precluding improvement. In this study, we used computational modeling to investigate which neuronal elements are activated directly by SCS, and how various physiological and technical factors influence the neural response. To simulate the neural response to SCS, we evaluated the SCS-produced voltage distributions using the finite element method and then applied these voltages to biophysical neuron models of local cells in the spinal cord's dorsal horn as well as primary afferent fibers. We performed this analysis for three common SCS paradigms - conventional (50 Hz), 10 kHz, and burst stimulation. Our results indicate that primary afferent fibers are recruited at lower stimulation amplitudes than local cells in the dorsal horn for all SCS paradigms. Furthermore, we observed that primary afferent collateralization patterns (i.e., number and spacing of collaterals) and medio-lateral electrode shift affected the neural response.					10th International IEEE-EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)10th International IEEE-EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAY 04-06, 2021MAY 04-06, 2021	Medtronic; Blackrock Microsystems; IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc; Inst Italiano Tecnologia; Biorobot Inst; Sant Anna Sch Adv Studies; Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn; Wearable Robot; Frontiers Neuroscience; EPFL; Elsevier; CorTec; Abbott; Univ Pittsburgh; IEEE Transact Neural Syst & Rehabilitat Engn; IEEE Open Journal Engn Med & BiolMedtronic; Blackrock Microsystems; IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc; Inst Italiano Tecnologia; Biorobot Inst; Sant Anna Sch Adv Studies; Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn; Wearable Robot; Frontiers Neuroscience; EPFL; Elsevier; CorTec; Abbott; Univ Pittsburgh; IEEE Transact Neural Syst & Rehabilitat Engn; IEEE Open Journal Engn Med & Biol	Prague, ELECTR NETWORKPrague, ELECTR NETWORK										1948-3546		978-1-7281-4337-8	WOS:000681358200052

Biophysics of Temporal Interference Stimulation								CELL SYSTEMS				11	6			557	+		10.1016/j.cels.2020.10.004				DEC 16 2020	2020	Temporal interference (TI) is a non-invasive neurostimulation technique that utilizes high-frequency external electric fields to stimulate deep neuronal structures without affecting superficial, off-target structures. TI represents a potential breakthrough for treating conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and chronic pain. However, early clinical work on TI stimulation was met with mixed outcomes challenging its fundamental mechanisms and applications. Here, we apply established physics to study the mechanisms of TI with the goal of optimizing it for clinical use. We argue that TI stimulation cannot work via passive membrane filtering, as previously hypothesized. Instead, TI stimulation requires an ion-channel mediated signal rectification process. Unfortunately, this mechanism is also responsible for high-frequency conduction block in off-target tissues, thus challenging clinical applications of TI. In consequence, we propose a set of experimental controls that should be performed in future experiments to refine our understanding and practice of TI stimulation. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.																		2405-4712	2405-4720		WOS:000599906400004	33157010

However, without knowing how best to stimulate the nerve fibers, the elicited sensation quality will always remain poor and unnatural.New Method: A new biomimetic 3D TENS computational model is developed to quantify the neural activation mechanism with varied surface electrodes. This model includes seven-layered anatomical structure of the forearm and biophysically-detailed myelinated A beta fibers. The A beta-fiber diameters from 1.5 - 7.5 mu m were randomly distributed beneath the skin to mimic the physiologically-realistic fiber population. The arithmetic averaging algorithm and Gaussian filter were adopted to identify the sensation center and to quantify sensation intensities under different stimulation conditions.Results: Fibers larger than 4.5 mu m can usually be activated producing tactile sensations such as light touch, pressure, buzz, and vibration. While, fibers with diameters of 3.5 and 3 mu m can only be excited at uncomfortable numb and pain sensations. The resulted modelling predictions match the recent psychophysical experimental data.Comparison with Existing Method(s): The new TENS model is more physiologically-realistic by introducing a detailed morphological information and key ionic mechanisms in nerve fibers.Conclusions: Our results indicate that TENS may be a promising method to target functionally-distinct neural pathways in an effort to improve the elicited tactile sensations quality with electrical stimulation. This work provides a promising platform of discovering neural mechanisms under TENS.																		0165-0270	1872-678X		WOS:000580629300002	32798529

We present a UK study analyzing explants of electrical neuromodulation devices for different conditions over 11 years in a single center specializing in neuromodulation.Methods A retrospective analysis was performed using a departmental database between 2008 and 2019. Explants were analyzed according to condition, mode of stimulation and other demographics using logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier graphs with log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.Results Out of a total of 1177 patients, the explant rate was 17.8% at 5 years and 25.2% at 10 years. Loss of efficacy was the most frequent reason for explant 119/181 (65%). Multivariant regression analysis indicated patients with back pain without prior surgery had a reduced risk of explant (p=0.03). Patients with SCS systems that had 10 kHz, options of multiple waveforms, and rechargeable batteries also had a decreased risk of explant (p<0.001). None of these findings were confirmed when comparing Kaplan-Meier graphs, however. Contrary to other studies, we found gender and age were not independent variables for explant.Conclusion These data contribute to a growing list of explant data in the scientific literature and give indications of what factors contribute to long-term utilization of electrical neuromodulation devices.																		1098-7339	1532-8651		WOS:000582823200008	32848088

This study explored the prevalence of pain associated with Implantable Pulse Generators (IPGs), the component that powers the SCS system.Methods This was a retrospective, single site study analyzing data from 764 patients who had a fully implanted SCS between September 2013 and March 2020. Demographic data were collected together with IPG site and type, patient reported presence of IPG site pain, revisions, explants and baseline scores for neuropathic pain (using the Self-Administered Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs questionnaire). Data were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, independent sample t-tests, X-2 tests of independence and logistic regression modeling.Results IPG site pain occurred in 127 (17%) of 764 patients. These patients had higher baseline neuropathic pain scores than those who reported no IPG site pain. This complication was more common in females than males. The lowest rates of IPG site pain occurred after posterior chest wall placement and the highest rates occurred after abdominal implants. 7% of patients had revision surgery for IPG site pain (n=55) and 10 of 95 explanted patients stated that IPG site pain was a secondary influencing factor.Conclusions These findings suggest that IPG site pain is a common complication, contributing to SCS revisions and explantation. This study shows that anatomical factors and baseline characteristics of individual patients may contribute to IPG site pain and indicates that exploration of potential factors leading to IPG revision is required.																		1098-7339	1532-8651		WOS:000582823200009	32938712

Quantification of clinically applicable stimulation parameters for precision near-organ neuromodulation of human splenic nerves								COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY				3	1					577	10.1038/s42003-020-01299-0				OCT 16 2020	2020	Neuromodulation is a new therapeutic pathway to treat inflammatory conditions by modulating the electrical signalling pattern of the autonomic connections to the spleen. However, targeting this sub-division of the nervous system presents specific challenges in translating nerve stimulation parameters. Firstly, autonomic nerves are typically embedded non-uniformly among visceral and connective tissues with complex interfacing requirements. Secondly, these nerves contain axons with populations of varying phenotypes leading to complexities for axon engagement and activation. Thirdly, clinical translational of methodologies attained using preclinical animal models are limited due to heterogeneity of the intra- and inter-species comparative anatomy and physiology. Here we demonstrate how this can be accomplished by the use of in silico modelling of target anatomy, and validation of these estimations through ex vivo human tissue electrophysiology studies. Neuroelectrical models are developed to address the challenges in translation of parameters, which provides strong input criteria for device design and dose selection prior to a first-in-human trial. Due to the difference between rodent, porcine and human nerve morphology, Gupta et al. propose an integrative approach of computational modelling and ex vivo electrophysiology studies to identify clinically relevant optimal parameters for human peripheral nerve stimulation as a therapeutic tool. The agreement between results validate the use of computer simulations as a first step toward determining stimulation parameters to provide input criteria for device design and dose selection prior to first-in-human trials.																			2399-3642		WOS:000583305400002	33067560

Research design and methods This case-series evaluated 420 patients with chronic back and/or leg pain implanted with an SCS device capable of sequential or simultaneous delivery of neurostimulation (i.e. combination therapy) as well as multiple waveforms and/or field shapes. Following implantation, an array of standard programs (e.g. paresthesia-based SCS), and a custom set of sub-perception programs were provided per patient feedback. Pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS) were collected at baseline and during follow-up. Results In this multicenter, observational series (n = 420, 53.1% female; Age: 64.2 +/- 13.4 years), a mean overall pain score of 7.2 +/- 1.8 (SD) was reported pre-trial (Baseline). At a mean follow-up duration of 208 +/- 200 (SD) days, the mean overall pain score reduced to 2.4 (p < 0.0001). Overall pain was reduced by 5.1 +/- 2.4 and 4.5 +/- 2.4 points (NRS) at 3-months (N = 256) and at 12-months post-implant (N = 122) respectively (p < 0.0001). Conclusions These results suggest that highly 'customizable' SCS approaches may allow for highly effective pain relief within the real-world clinical setting.																		1743-4440	1745-2422		WOS:000571559600001	32883126

CS is characterized by activation of unmyelinated C-fibers resulting in a cascade of events at molecular and cellular levels which eventuate into generation of synaptic currents at rest. CS, therefore, contributes to heightened generalized pain sensitivity, further complicates the process of reaching a diagnosis, and increases the possibility of treatment failure.Body: Trigeminal nerve is the main sensory supplier of the anterior part of the head, including the intraoral structures. Primary afferent nociceptors of the trigeminal nerve and low threshold mechanoreceptors synapse with wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in the pons. This multifaceted network of nerve interactions which is further complicated by the modulatory circuits that can suppress or heighten the activity of WDR neurons is one of the main contributors to CS. The importance of CS in orofacial pain disorders is emphasized in the context of chronic pain development. As for all chronic pain conditions, it is crucial to consider the biopsychosocial aspects of chronic orofacial pain in managing this diverse group of conditions. This review highlights current understanding of the biopsychosocial model and central mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of chronic orofacial pain.																		0904-2512	1600-0714		WOS:000562475100005	32539196

The Effect of Clinically Controllable Factors on Neural Activation During Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation								NEUROMODULATION				24	4			655	671		10.1111/ner.13211		JUN 2020		JUN 2021	2021	Objective Dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) is an effective therapy for chronic pain, though its mechanisms of action are unknown. Currently, we do not understand how clinically controllable parameters (e.g., electrode position, stimulus pulse width) affect the direct neural response to DRGS. Therefore, the goal of this study was to utilize a computational modeling approach to characterize how varying clinically controllable parameters changed neural activation profiles during DRGS. Materials and Methods We coupled a finite element model of a human L5 DRG to multicompartment models of primary sensory neurons (i.e., A alpha-, A beta-, A delta-, and C-neurons). We calculated the stimulation amplitudes necessary to elicit one or more action potentials in each neuron, and examined how neural activation profiles were affected by varying clinically controllable parameters. Results In general, DRGS predominantly activated large myelinated A alpha- and A beta-neurons. Shifting the electrode more than 2 mm away from the ganglion abolished most DRGS-induced neural activation. Increasing the stimulus pulse width to 500 mu s or greater increased the number of activated A delta-neurons, while shorter pulse widths typically only activated A alpha- and A beta-neurons. Placing a cathode near a nerve root, or an anode near the ganglion body, maximized A beta-mechanoreceptor activation. Guarded active contact configurations did not activate more A beta-mechanoreceptors than conventional bipolar configurations. Conclusions Our results suggest that DRGS applied with stimulation parameters within typical clinical ranges predominantly activates A beta-mechanoreceptors. In general, varying clinically controllable parameters affects the number of A beta-mechanoreceptors activated, although longer pulse widths can increase A delta-neuron activation. Our data support several Neuromodulation Appropriateness Consensus Committee guidelines on the clinical implementation of DRGS.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000542480900001	32583523

Anatomical and technical factors affecting the neural response to epidural spinal cord stimulation								JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING				17	3					036019	10.1088/1741-2552/ab8fc4				JUN 2020	2020	Objective. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a common neurostimulation therapy to treat chronic pain. Computational models represent a valuable tool to study the potential mechanisms of action of SCS and to optimize the design and implementation of SCS technologies. However, it is imperative that these computational models include the appropriate level of detail to accurately predict the neural response to SCS and to correlate model predictions with clinical outcomes. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate several anatomic and technical factors that may affect model-based predictions of neural activation during thoracic SCS.Approach. We developed computational models that consisted of detailed finite element models of the lower thoracic spinal cord, surrounding tissues, and implanted SCS electrode arrays. We positioned multicompartment models of sensory axons within the spinal cord to calculate the activation threshold for each sensory axon. We then investigated how activation thresholds changed as a function of several anatomical variables (e.g. spine geometry, dorsal rootlet anatomy), stimulation type (i.e. voltage-controlled vs. current-controlled), electrode impedance, lead position, lead type, and electrical properties of surrounding tissues (e.g. dura conductivity, frequency-dependent conductivity).Main results.Several anatomic and modeling factors produced significant percent differences or errors in activation thresholds. Rostrocaudal positioning of the cathode with respect to the vertebrae had a large effect (up to 32%) on activation thresholds. Variability in electrode impedance produced significant changes in activation thresholds for voltage-controlled stimulation (38% to 51%), but had little effect on activation thresholds for current-controlled stimulation (less than 13%). Changing the dura conductivity also produced significant differences in activation thresholds.Significance.This study demonstrates several anatomic and technical factors that can affect the neural response to SCS. These factors should be considered in clinical implementation and in future computational modeling studies of thoracic SCS.																		1741-2560	1741-2552		WOS:000542229900001	32365340

However, CNOP is known to be a heterogeneous group of orofacial pain disorders, which can lead to different responses to iMCS. Therefore, this paper investigated (1) whether the effectiveness of iMCS is significantly different among different CNOP disorders and (2) whether other confounding factors can be impacting iMCS results in CNOP. A systematic review and meta-analysis using a linear mixed-model was performed. Twenty-three papers were included, totaling 140 CNOP patients. Heterogeneity of the studies showed to be 55.8%. A visual analogue scale (VAS) measured median pain relief of 66.5% (ranging from 0-100%) was found. Linear mixed-model analysis showed that patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia responded significantly more favorable to iMCS than patients suffering from dysfunctional pain syndromes (p=0.030). Also, patients suffering from CNOP caused by (supra)nuclear lesions responded marginally significantly better to iMCS than patients suffering from CNOP due to trigeminal nerve lesions (p=0.049). No other confounding factors were elucidated. This meta-analysis showed that patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia and patients suffering from (supra)nuclear lesions causing CNOP responded significantly more favorable than others on iMCS. No other confounding factors were found relevant.																		2045-2322			WOS:000560714800002	32346080

However, their use can result in a number of unwanted side-effects including incomplete efficacy, constipation, physical dependence, and overdose liability. Cannabinoids enhance the pain-relieving effects of opioids in preclinical studies and dampen unwanted side-effects resulting from excessive opioid intake. We recently reported that a CB1 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) exhibits antinociceptive efficacy in models of pathological pain and lacks the adverse side effects of direct CB1 receptor activation. In the present study, we evaluated whether a CB1 PAM would enhance morphine's therapeutic efficacy in an animal model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and characterized its impact on unwanted side-effects associated with chronic opioid administration. In paclitaxel-treated mice, both the CB1 PAM GAT211 and the opioid analgesic morphine reduced paclitaxel-induced behavioral hypersensitivities to mechanical and cold stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. Isobolographic analysis revealed that combinations of GAT211 and morphine resulted in anti-allodynic synergism. In paclitaxel-treated mice, a sub-threshold dose of GAT211 prevented the development of tolerance to the anti-allodynic effects of morphine over 20 days of once daily dosing. However, GAT211 did not reliably alter somatic withdrawal signs (i.e., jumps, paw tremors) in morphine-dependent neuropathic mice challenged with naloxone. In otherwise naive mice, GAT211 also prolonged antinociceptive efficacy of morphine in the tail-flick test and reduced the overall right-ward shift in the ED50 for morphine to produce antinociception in the tail-flick test, consistent with attenuation of morphine tolerance. Pretreatment with GAT211 did not alter somatic signs of mu opioid receptor dependence in mice rendered dependent upon morphine via subcutaneous implantation of a morphine pellet. Moreover, GAT211 did not reliably alter mu-opioid receptor-mediated reward as measured by conditioned place preference to morphine. Our results suggest that a CB1 PAM may be beneficial in enhancing and prolonging the therapeutic properties of opioids while potentially sparing unwanted side-effects (e.g., tolerance) that occur with repeated opioid treatment.																		1662-5099			WOS:000534248500001	32410959

Modulation of neuroglial interactions using differential target multiplexed spinal cord stimulation in an animal model of neuropathic pain								MOLECULAR PAIN				16						1744806920918057	10.1177/1744806920918057				APR 2020	2020	The development and maintenance of chronic neuropathic pain involves distorted neuroglial interactions, which result in prolonged perturbations of immune and inflammatory response, as well as disrupted synapses and cellular interactions. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has proven effective and safe for more than 40 years, but comprehensive understanding of its mode of action remains elusive. Previous work in our laboratory provided evidence that conventional SCS parameters modulate biological processes associated with neuropathic pain in animals. This inspired the development of differential target multiplexed programming (DTMP) in which multiple electrical signals are used for modulating glial cells and neurons in order to rebalance their interactions. This work compares DTMP with both low rate and high rate programming using an animal model of neuropathic pain. The spared nerve injury model was implemented in 48 rats equally randomized into four experimental groups: No-SCS, DTMP, low rate, and high rate. Naive animals (N = 7) served as a reference control. SCS was applied continuously for 48 h and pain-related behavior assessed before and after SCS. RNA from the spinal cord exposed to SCS was sequenced to determine changes in gene expression as a result of injury (No-SCS vs. naive) and as a result of SCS (SCS vs. No-SCS). Bioinformatics tools (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis and Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis) were used to evaluate the significance of the results. All three therapies significantly reduced mechanical hypersensitivity, although DTMP provided statistically better results overall. DTMP also reduced thermal hypersensitivity significantly. RNA-sequencing corroborated the complex effects of nerve injury on the transcriptome. In addition, DTMP provided significantly more effective modulation of genes associated with pain-related processes in returning their expression toward levels observed in naive, noninjured animals. DTMP provides a more effective way of modulating the expression of genes involved in pain-relevant biological processes associated with neuroglial interactions.																			1744-8069		WOS:000529437800001	32290778	
J	Zelechowski, Marek; Valle, Giacomo; Raspopovic, Stanisa								A computational model to design neural interfaces for lower-limb sensory neuroprostheses								JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION				17	1					24	10.1186/s12984-020-00657-7				FEB 19 2020	2020	Background Leg amputees suffer the lack of sensory feedback from a prosthesis, which is connected to their low confidence during walking, falls and low mobility. Electrical peripheral nerve stimulation (ePNS) of upper-limb amputee's residual nerves has shown the ability to restore the sensations from the missing limb via intraneural (TIME) and epineural (FINE) neural interfaces. Physiologically plausible stimulation protocols targeting lower limb sciatic nerve hold promise to induce sensory feedback restoration that should facilitate close-to-natural sensorimotor integration and therefore walking corrections. The sciatic nerve, innervating the foot and lower leg, has very different dimensions in respect to upper-limb nerves. Therefore, there is a need to develop a computational model of its behavior in response to the ePNS. Methods We employed a hybrid FEM-NEURON model framework for the development of anatomically correct sciatic nerve model. Based on histological images of two distinct sciatic nerve cross-sections, we reconstructed accurate FEM models for testing neural interfaces. Two different electrode types (based on TIME and FINE) with multiple active sites configurations were tested and evaluated for efficiency (selective recruitment of fascicles). We also investigated different policies of stimulation (monopolar and bipolar), as well as the optimal number of implants. Additionally, we optimized the existing simulation framework significantly reducing the computational load. Results The main findings achieved through our modelling study include electrode manufacturing and surgical placement indications, together with beneficial stimulation policy of use. It results that TIME electrodes with 20 active sites are optimal for lower limb and the same number has been obtained for FINE electrodes. To interface the huge sciatic nerve, model indicates that 3 TIMEs is the optimal number of surgically implanted electrodes. Through the bipolar policy of stimulation, all studied configurations were gaining in the efficiency. Also, an indication for the optimized computation is given, which decreased the computation time by 80%. Conclusions This computational model suggests the optimal interfaces to use in human subjects with lower limb amputation, their surgical placement and beneficial bipolar policy of stimulation. It will potentially enable the clinical translation of the sensory neuroprosthetics towards the lower limb applications.																			1743-0003		WOS:000517986900003	32075654

The most commonly used implantable devices are spinal cord stimulation (SCS) systems or targeted drug delivery (TDD) devices. Historically, SCS had been considered in advance of TDD, positioning TDD behind SCS failures. Following Institutional Review Board approval, data were extracted from electronic medical records of patients who underwent SCS trial in the Department of Pain Management at Cleveland Clinic from 1994 to 2013. The sample size was analyzed in two cohorts: those who succeeded with SCS and those who failed SCS and consequently proceeded to TDD. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed and a predictive formula for successful outcomes was created. 945 patients were included in the cohort of which 119 (12.6%) subjects achieved adequate pain relief with TDD after failure of SCS. Gender, age, depression and primary pain diagnosis were significantly different in this subgroup. Males were 52% less likely to experience pain relief with SCS. The odds of SCS success decreased as age increased by 6% per year. Patients with comorbid depression, interestingly, were 63% more likely to succeed with SCS. A logistic model was created to predict SCS success which was used to create a predictive formula. Older male patients diagnosed with spine-related pain were more likely to benefit from TDD than SCS. This observation potentially identifies a subgroup in whom consideration for TDD in advance of SCS failure could prove more efficient and cost effective. These retrospective findings warrant prospective comparative studies to validate this derived predictive formula.																		1098-7339	1532-8651		WOS:000518228500007	31932490

Elucidating Somatization in a Dimensional Model of Psychopathology Across Medical Settings								JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY				129	2			162	176		10.1037/abn0000475				FEB 2020	2020	Research using a categorical-polythetic classification system for mental illness has raised concern regarding the validity of categorical classification systems. Recent efforts suggest psychopathology is better understood from a dimensional framework, though there has been varying evidence of a somatization factor. The current investigation seeks to produce and validate a dimensional model of psychopathology, with a particular emphasis on the placement of somatization, across three nonoverlapping medical samples. Using a bariatric surgery seeking sample (n = 1,268), a spine surgery/spinal cord stimulator seeking sample (n = 1,711), and a chronic pain treatment seeking sample (n = 1,388), a dimensional model of psychopathology was replicated across all three samples using a dimensional measure of psychopathology (the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form [MMPI-2-RF]). Clear evidence of a separate somatization factor was found in addition to broad internalizing, externalizing, and social detachment factors. Constructs assessable with the model yielded good convergent and discriminant validity coefficients with external criteria, and further supported the presence of a higher-order somatization construct.																		0021-843X	1939-1846		WOS:000509217000002	31599632	
J	Smith, Trevor M.; Lee, Dongchul; Bradley, Kerry; McMahon, Stephen B.								Methodology for quantifying excitability of identified projection neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, specifically to study spinal cord stimulation paradigms								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS				330						108479	10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.108479				JAN 15 2020	2020	Background: Using in and ex vivo preparations, electrophysiological methods help understand the excitability of biological tissue, particularly neurons, by providing microsecond temporal resolution. However, for in vivo recordings, in the context of extracellular recordings, it is often unclear precisely which type of neuron the tip of the electrode is recording from. This is particularly true in the densely-populated central nervous system, such as the spinal cord dorsal horn at both superficial and deep levels.New Method: Here, we present a detailed protocol for the identification of superficial dorsal horn spinal cord neurons that receive peripheral input and project to the brain, using multiple surgical laminectomies and the careful placement of electrodes. Once a superficial projection unit was found, quantification to electrical peripheral stimulation was performed using a Matlab algorithm to form a template of projection neuron response to controlled C2 stimulation and accurately match this to the responses from peripheral stimulation.Results: These superficial spinal projection neurons are normally activated by noxious peripheral stimuli, so we adopted a well-characterised wind-up protocol to obtain a neuronal excitability profile. Once achieved, this protocol allows for testing specific interventions, either pharmacological or neuromodulatory (e.g., spinal cord stimulation) to see how these affect the neuron's excitability. This preparation is robust and allows the accurate tracking of a projection neuron for over 3-h.Comparison with existing method(s): Currently, most existing methods record from dorsal horn neurons that are often profiled based on their excitability to different peripherally-applied sensory modalities. While this is wellestablished, it fails to discriminate between interneurons and projection neurons, which is important as these two populations signal via distinctly different neuronal networks. Using the approach detailed here will result in studies with improved mechanistic understanding of the signal integration and processing that occurs in the superficial dorsal horn.Conclusions: The refinements detailed in this protocol allow for more comprehensive studies to be carried out that will help understand spinal plasticity, in addition to many considerations for isolating the relevant neuronal population when performing in vivo electrophysiology.																		0165-0270	1872-678X		WOS:000515428200004	31705935

The Volume 30 (1), 2020 of the EJTM opens with the collection of abstracts for the conference "2020 Padua Muscle Days: Mobility Medicine 30 years of Translational Research". This is an international conference that will be held between March 18-21, 2020 in Euganei Hills and Padova in Italy. The abstracts are excellent examples of translational research and of the multidimensional approaches that are needed to classify and manage (in both the acute and chronic phases) diseases of Mobility that span from neurologic, metabolic and traumatic syndromes to the biological process of aging. One of the typical aim of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation is indeed to reduce pain and increase mobility enough to enable impaired persons to walk freely, garden, and drive again. The excellent contents of this Collection of Abstracts reflect the high scientific caliber of researchers and clinicians who are eager to present their results at the PaduaMuscleDays. A series of EJTM Communications will also add to this preliminary evidence.																		2037-7452	2037-7460		WOS:000566757600002	32499887

Bioelectronic medicine				6				10	10		10.1186/s42234-020-00047-3				2020	2020	Efficient identification of effective neurostimulation strategies is critical due to the growing number of clinical applications and the increasing complexity of the corresponding technology. In consequence, investigators are encouraged to accelerate translational research of neurostimulation technologies and move quickly to clinical applications. However, this process is hampered by rigorous, but necessary, regulations and lack of a mechanistic understanding of the interactions between electric fields and neural circuits. Here we discuss how computational models have influenced the field of neurostimulation for pain and movement recovery, deep brain stimulation, and even device regulations. Finally, we propose our vision on how computational models will be key to accelerate clinical developments through mechanistic understanding.																			2332-8886		MEDLINE:32490037	32490037

Evoked Potentials Recorded From the Spinal Cord During Neurostimulation for Pain: A Computational Modeling Study								NEUROMODULATION				23	1			64	73		10.1111/ner.12965				JAN 2020	2020	Objectives Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for pain is typically implemented in an open-loop manner using parameters that remain largely unchanged. To improve the overall efficacy and consistency of SCS, one closed-loop approach proposes to use evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) recorded from the SCS lead(s) as a feedback control signal to guide parameter selection. The goal of this study was to use a computational modeling approach to investigate the source of these ECAP recordings and technical and physiological factors that affect their composition. Methods We developed a computational model that coupled a finite element model of lower thoracic SCS with multicompartment models of sensory axons within the spinal cord. We used a reciprocity-based approach to calculate SCS-induced ECAPs recorded from the SCS lead. Results Our model ECAPs contained a triphasic, P1, N1, P2 morphology. The model P2-N1 amplitudes and conduction velocities agreed with previous experimental data from human subjects. Model results suggested that the ECAPs are dominated by the activation of axons with diameters 8.7-10.0 mu m located in the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. We also observed changes in the ECAP amplitude and shape due to the electrode location relative to the vertebrae and spinal cord. Conclusion Our modeling results suggest that clinically effective SCS relies on the activation of numerous axons within a narrow fiber diameter range and that several factors affect the composition of the ECAP recordings. These results can improve how we interpret and implement these recordings in a potential closed-loop approach to SCS.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000509501400009	31215720

Evoked Compound Action Potentials Reveal Spinal Cord Dorsal Column Neuroanatomy								NEUROMODULATION				23	1			82	95		10.1111/ner.12968				JAN 2020	2020	Introduction The electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) is a measure of the response from a population of fibers to an electrical stimulus. ECAPs can be assessed during spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to elucidate the relationship between stimulation, electrophysiological response, and neuromodulation. This has consequences for the design and programming of SCS devices. Methods Sheep were implanted with linear epidural SCS leads. After a stimulating pulse, electrodes recorded ECAPs sequentially as they propagated orthodromically or antidromically. After filtering, amplification, and signal processing, ECAP amplitude and dispersion (width) was measured, and conduction velocity was calculated. Similar clinical data was also collected. A single-neuron computer model that simulated large-diameter sensory axons was used to explore and explain the observations. Results ECAPs, both animal and human, have a triphasic structure, with P1, N1, and P2 peaks. Conduction velocity in sheep was 109 ms(-1), which indicates that the underlying neural population includes fibers of up to 20 mu m in diameter. For travel in both directions, propagation distance was associated with decrease in amplitude and increase in dispersion. Importantly, characteristics of these changes shifted abruptly at various positions along the cord. Discussion ECAP dispersion increases with propagation distance due to the contribution of slow-conducting small-diameter fibers as the signal propagates away from the source. An analysis of the discontinuities in ECAP dispersion changes with propagation revealed that these are due to the termination of smaller-diameter, slower-conducting fibers at corresponding segmental levels. The implications regarding SCS lead placement, toward the goal of maximizing clinical benefit while minimizing side-effects, are discussed.

Fiber Threshold Accommodation as a Mechanism of Burst and High-Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation								NEUROMODULATION											10.1111/ner.13076		NOV 2019			2019	Objectives Burst and high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS), in contrast to low-frequency stimulation (LFS, < 200 Hz), reduce neuropathic pain without the side effect of paresthesia, yet it is unknown whether these methods' mechanisms of action (MoA) overlap. We used empirically based computational models of fiber threshold accommodation to examine the three MoA. Materials and Methods Waveforms used in SCS are composed of cathodic, anodic, and rest phases. Empirical studies of human peripheral sensory nerve fibers show different accommodation effects occurring in each phase. Notably, larger diameter fibers accommodate more than smaller fibers. We augmented our computational axon model to replicate fiber threshold accommodation behavior for diameters from 5 to 15 mu m in each phase. We used the model to predict threshold change in variations of burst, high frequency, and LFS. Results The accommodation model showed that 1) inversion of larger and smaller diameter fiber thresholds produce a therapeutic window in which smaller fibers fire while larger ones do not and 2) the anodic pulses increase accommodation and perpetuate threshold inversion from burst to burst and between cathodic pulses in burst, high frequency, and variations, resulting in an amplitude "window" in which larger fibers are inactivated while smaller fibers fire. No threshold inversion was found for traditional LFS. Conclusions The model, based on empirical data, predicts that, at clinical amplitudes, burst and high-frequency SCS do not activate large-diameter fibers that produce paresthesia while driving medium-diameter fibers, likely different from LFS, which produce analgesia via different populations of dorsal horn neural circuits.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000498666400001	31774232

We developed an ex vivo adult mouse spinal cord preparation to assess recruitment following delivery of clinically analogous stimuli determined by downscaling a finite element model of clinical SCS. Analogous electric field distributions were generated with 300-mu m x 300-mu m electrodes positioned 200 mu m above the dorsal column (DC) with stimulation between 50 and 200 mu A. We compared axonal recruitment using electrodes of comparable size and stimulus amplitudes when contacting the caudal thoracic DC and at 200 or 600 mu m above. Antidromic responses recorded distally from the DC, the adjacent Lissauer tract (LT), and in dorsal roots (DRs) were found to be amplitude and site dependent. Responses in the DC included a unique component not seen in DRs, having the lowest SCS recruitment amplitude and fastest conduction velocity. At 200 mu m above, mean cathodic SCS recruitment threshold for axons in DRs and LT were 2.6 and 4.4 times higher, respectively, than DC threshold. SCS recruited primary afferents in all (up to 8) caudal segments sampled. Whereas A and C fibers could be recruited at nearby segments, only A fiber recruitment and synaptically mediated dorsal root reflexes were observed in more distant (lumbar) segments. In sum, clinically analogous SCS led to multisegmental recruitment of several somatosensory-encoding axonal populations. Most striking is the possibility that the lowest threshold recruitment of a nonprimary afferent population in the DC are postsynaptic dorsal column tract cells (PSDCs) projecting to gracile nuclei.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is used clinically to control pain. To identify axonal populations recruited, finite element modeling identified scaling parameters to deliver clinically analogous SCS in an ex vivo adult mouse spinal cord preparation. Results showed that SCS first recruited an axonal population in the dorsal column at a threshold severalfold lower than primary afferents. These putative postsynaptic dorsal column tract cells may represent a previously unconsidered population responsible for SCS-induced paresthesias necessary for analgesia.																		0022-3077	1522-1598		WOS:000491469500011	31339796

Patient-Specific Analysis of Neural Activation During Spinal Cord Stimulation for Pain								NEUROMODULATION				23	5			572	593		10.1111/ner.13037		AUG 2019		JUL 2020	2020	Objective Despite the widespread use of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for chronic pain management, its neuromodulatory effects remain poorly understood. Computational models provide a valuable tool to study SCS and its effects on axonal pathways within the spinal cord. However, these models must include sufficient detail to correlate model predictions with clinical effects, including patient-specific data. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate axonal activation at clinically relevant SCS parameters using a computer model that incorporated patient-specific anatomy and electrode locations. Methods We developed a patient-specific computer model for a patient undergoing SCS to treat chronic pain. This computer model consisted of two main components: 1) finite element model of the extracellular voltages generated by SCS and 2) multicompartment cable models of axons in the spinal cord. To determine the potential significance of a patient-specific approach, we also performed simulations with standard canonical models of SCS. We used the computer models to estimate axonal activation at clinically measured sensory, comfort, and discomfort thresholds. Results The patient-specific and canonical models predicted significantly different axonal activation. Relative to the canonical models, the patient-specific model predicted sensory threshold estimates that were more consistent with the corresponding clinical measurements. These results suggest that it is important to account for sources of interpatient variability (e.g., anatomy, electrode locations) in model-based analysis of SCS. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential for patient-specific computer models to quantitatively describe the axonal response to SCS and to address scientific questions related to clinical SCS.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000484382900001	31464040	
J	Duan, Wanru; Huang, Qian; Chen, Zhiyong; Raja, Srinivasa N.; Yang, Fei; Guan, Yun								Comparisons of motor and sensory abnormalities after lumbar and thoracic contusion spinal cord injury in male rats								NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS				708						134358	10.1016/j.neulet.2019.134358				AUG 24 2019	2019	Rodent models of contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) are widely studied for the mechanisms underlying functional deficits after SCI. Yet, how does lesion level affect SCI-induced motor and sensory dysfunctions remains unclear. Using a computer-controlled impactor (Impact One (TM), Leica) and the same parameters (diameter, 2.0 mm; Speed: 4.0 m/s; Depth: 1.5 mm; Dwell time: 0.1 s), we produced contusions at mid-thoracic (T10) and rostral-lumbar (L2) spinal cord in male rats, and compared locomotor and sensory dysfunctions within the same experimental setting. The time courses of locomotor deficit were comparable between thoracic (n = 8) and lumbar (n = 7) SCI rats, but the severity was greater after thoracic SCI especially during the first week post-injury, as indicated by the lower Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan open-field locomotion scores. Both groups showed similar heightened avoiding response (hyper-reactivity) to mechanical stimulation applied at the hindpaws from day 21-56 post-injury, as indicated by decreased paw withdrawal thresholds. Compared to lumbar SCI, thoracic SCI induced a greater decrease of paw withdrawal latency in hot-plate test from day 28-56 post-injury. In contrast, lumbar SCI rats showed a greater reduction of avoidance threshold to mechanical stimulation at the girdle region, and larger overgroomed area than thoracic SCI rats at day 14 post-injury. Thus, thoracic SCI may induce greater motor deficits and hindpaw heat hyper-reactivity than did lumbar SCI. In contrast, lumbar SCI may elicit greater at level mechanical hyper-reactivity and overgrooming behavior than thoracic SCI. Future study needs to examine the specific pathological changes underlying different dysfunctions in two SCI models.																		0304-3940	1872-7972		WOS:000483006100022	31269465

This study used 7 Tesla diffusion MR tractography on a human cadaver that was harvested 24 hours post mortem to evaluate cuneate fasciculus anatomy in cervical spinal cord. Based on this method, for the first time much more nuanced tractographic anatomy was used to investigate possible new routes for cuneate fasciculus in the posterior and lateral funiculus. Additionally, current molecular tracing studies were reviewed, and confirmatory data was presented along with our radiological results. Both studies confirm that upon entry to the spinal cord, upper cervical level tracts (C1-2-3) travel inside lateral funiculus and lower level tracts travel medially inside the posterior funiculus after entry at posterolateral sulcus which is different than traditional knowledge of having cuneate fasciculus tracts concentrated in the lateral part of posterior funiculus.																		1053-8119	1095-9572		WOS:000470833800019	30981859	
J	Crodelle, Jennifer; Piltz, Sofia H.; Hagenauer, Megan Hastings; Booth, Victoria								Modeling the daily rhythm of human pain processing in the dorsal horn								PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY				15	7					e1007106	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007106				JUL 2019	2019	Experimental studies show that human pain sensitivity varies across the 24-hour day, with the lowest sensitivity usually occurring during the afternoon. Patients suffering from neuropathic pain, or nerve damage, experience an inversion in the daily modulation of pain sensitivity, with the highest sensitivity usually occurring during the early afternoon. Processing of painful stimulation occurs in the dorsal horn (DH), an area of the spinal cord that receives input from peripheral tissues via several types of primary afferent nerve fibers. The DH circuit is composed of different populations of neurons, including excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, and projection neurons, which constitute the majority of the output from the DH to the brain. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of the dorsal horn neural circuit to investigate mechanisms for the daily modulation of pain sensitivity. The model describes average firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations and projection neurons, whose activity is directly correlated with experienced pain. Response in afferent fibers to peripheral stimulation is simulated by a Poisson process generating nerve fiber spike trains at variable firing rates. Model parameters for fiber response to stimulation and the excitability properties of neuronal populations are constrained by experimental results found in the literature, leading to qualitative agreement between modeled responses to pain and experimental observations. We validate our model by reproducing the wind-up of pain response to repeated stimulation. We apply the model to investigate daily modulatory effects on pain inhibition, in which response to painful stimuli is reduced by subsequent non-painful stimuli. Finally, we use the model to propose a mechanism for the observed inversion of the daily rhythmicity of pain sensation under neuropathic pain conditions. Underlying mechanisms for the shift in rhythmicity have not been identified experimentally, but our model results predict that experimentally-observed dysregulation of inhibition within the DH neural circuit may be responsible. The model provides an accessible, biophysical framework that will be valuable for experimental and clinical investigations of diverse physiological processes modulating pain processing in humans.																			1553-7358		WOS:000481577700023	31295266

Dorsal root ganglion stimulation for chronic pain modulates A beta-fiber activity but not C-fiber activity: A computational modeling study								CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				130	6			941	951		10.1016/j.clinph.2019.02.016				JUN 2019	2019	Objective: The goal of this project was to use computational models to investigate which types of primary sensory neurons are modulated by dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) to provide pain relief.Methods: We modeled DRGS by coupling an anatomical finite element model of a human L5 dorsal root ganglion to biophysical models of primary sensory neurons. We calculated the stimulation amplitude needed to elicit an action potential in each neuron, and examined how DRGS affected sensory neuron activity.Results: We showed that within clinical ranges of stimulation parameters, DRGS drives the activity of large myelinated A beta-fibers but does not directly activate small nonmyelinated C-fibers. We also showed that the position of the active and return electrodes and the polarity of the stimulus pulse influence neural activation.Conclusions: Our results indicate that DRGS may provide pain relief by activating pain-gating mechanisms in the dorsal horn via repeated activation of large myelinated afferents.Significance: Understanding the mechanisms of action of DRGS-induced pain relief may lead to innovations in stimulation technologies that improve patient outcomes.

Investigation of Resting-State BOLD Networks in the Human Brainstem and Spinal Cord								NEUROSCIENCE				404				71	81		10.1016/j.neuroscience.2019.02.009				APR 15 2019	2019	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been used to investigate networks within the cortex and has also provided some insight into the networks present in the brainstem (BS) and spinal cord (SC). The purpose of this study was to investigate resting-state blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) fluctuations in the BS/SC and to identify resting-state networks (RSNs) across these regions. Resting-state BOLD fMRI data were obtained from the entire BS and cervical SC in 16 healthy participants, at 3 T, with T-2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo imaging. Data were spatially normalized and processed to remove physiological noise. Cluster-cluster functional connectivity was investigated across the entire 3D region by means of temporal correlations, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate RSNs. Extensive connectivity was observed within and across BS and SC regions, with connections spanning up to 120 mm, although shorter connections were more prevalent. SEM results revealed extensive brainstem-cord connectivity that included specific anatomical regions within the brainstem. The results indicate the presence of a complex resting-state network which is highly interconnected in the spinal cord. Known anatomical connections between cortical and BS regions support the conclusion that the observed resting-state BOLD fluctuations in the BS/SC may be related to autonomic regulation. Future studies are required to further investigate these resting-state BOLD networks. (C) 2019 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Most electroceutical devices use simple waveforms, for example sinusoidal or rectangular biphasic pulses. Clinicians empirically tune the waveform parameters (e.g. amplitude, frequency) without altering the fundamental shape of the stimulus. In this article, we review computational strategies that have been used to optimize the shape of stimulus waveforms in order to improve clinical outcomes, and we discuss potential directions for future exploration.

Our approach consisted of the combination of a finite element model of the spinal cord developed in COMSOL Multiphysics and a nerve fiber model implemented in MATLAB. Five evaluation parameters were evaluated, namely, the recruitment ratio, the perception and discomfort thresholds, and the activating area and depth. The results were compared quantitatively.ResultsThe dual-guarded cathode presents the maximum activating area and depth in single- and dual-lead stimulation. However, the lowest value of the ratio between the perception threshold in DC and the perception threshold in the dorsal root (DR) is achieved when the guarded cathode is programmed. Although the two versions of bipolar polarity (namely bipolar 1 and bipolar 2) produce higher activating area and depth than the guarded cathode, they are suitable for producing DR stimulation. Similarly, dual-lead stimulation is likely to activate DR fibers because the electrodes are closer to these fibers.ConclusionsThe results suggest that the activating area in the DC is maximized by using the dual-guarded cathode both in single- and dual-lead stimulation modes. However, DC nerve fibers are preferentially stimulated when the guarded cathode is used. According to these results, the new electrode programming strategy that we propose for clinical practice first uses the dual-guarded cathode, but, if the DR nerve fibers are activated, it then uses guarded cathode polarity.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000466335300006	30586207

A novel intradural electrical stimulation device, limited by the boundaries of the thecal sac, CSF and spinal cord was developed to test this hypothesis. In order to optimize device function, we have explored finite element modeling (FEM).Methods: COMSOL (R) Multiphysics Electrical Currents was used to solve for fields and currents over a geometric model of a spinal cord segment. Cathodic and anodic currents are applied to the center and tips of the T-cross component of the electrode array to shape the stimulation field and constrain charge-balanced cathodic pulses to the target area.Results: Currents from the electrode sites can move the effective stimulation zone horizontally across the cord by a linear step method, which can be diversified considerably to gain greater depth of penetration relative to standard epidural SCS. It is also possible to prevent spread of the target area with no off-target action potential.Conclusion: Finite element modeling of a T-shaped intradural spinal cord stimulator predicts significant gains in field depth and current shaping that are beyond the reach of epidural stimulators. Future studies with in vivo models will investigate how this approach should first be tested in humans.																		1662-453X			WOS:000461631800001	30941012

Autophagy is involved in the development and/or progression of many diseases, including neuropathic pain. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin relieves neuropathic pain in several neuropathic pain models; however, metformin's cellular and molecular mechanism for pain relief remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of metformin on pain relief after spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and its underlying mechanism of autophagy regulation. Behavioural analysis, histological assessment, expression of c-Fos and molecular biological changes, as well as ultrastructural features, were investigated. Our findings showed that the number of autophagosomes and expression of autophagy markers, such as LC3 and beclin1, were increased, while the autophagy substrate protein p62, as well as the ubiquitinated proteins, were accumulated in the ipsilateral spinal cord. However, metformin enhanced the expression of autophagy markers, while it abrogated the abundance of p62 and ubiquitinated proteins. Blockage of autophagy flux by chloroquine partially abolished the apoptosis inhibition and analgesic effects of metformin on SNL. Taken together, these results illustrated that metformin relieved neuropathic pain through autophagy flux stimulation and provided a new direction for metformin drug development to treat neuropathic pain.																			1582-4934		WOS:000459729900055	30451370

The current definition of pain relies on subjective reports in both humans and experimental animals. Such definition lacks basic mechanistic insights and can lead to a high degree of variability. Research on biomarkers for pain has previously focused on genetic analysis. However, recent advances in human neuroimaging and research in animal models have begun to show the promise of a circuit-based neural signature for pain. At the treatment level, pharmacological therapy for pain remains limited. Neuromodulation has emerged as a specific form of treatment without the systemic side effects of pharmacotherapies. In this review, we will discuss some of the current neuromodulatory modalities for pain, research on newer targets, as well as emerging possibility for an integrated brain-computer interface approach for pain management.																		0065-2598	2214-8019	978-981-13-2050-7; 978-981-13-2049-1	WOS:000516528700009	31729677

Computational models provide a valuable tool to study the effects of SCS on the nervous system. However, it is critical that these models include sufficient detail to correlate model predictions with clinical effects, including patient-specific data. Therefore, in this study, we developed a patient-specific computer model for a patient undergoing SCS to treat neuropathic pain. The patient-specific model predicted sensory threshold estimates that were consistent with the corresponding clinical measurements. These results demonstrate the potential for patient-specific computer models to quantitatively describe the axonal response to SCS and to address scientific questions related to clinical SCS.					4th International Conference on NeuroRehabilitation (ICNR)4th International Conference on NeuroRehabilitation (ICNR)	OCT 16-20, 2018OCT 16-20, 2018		Pisa, ITALYPisa, ITALY										2195-3562		978-3-030-01845-0; 978-3-030-01844-3	WOS:000614735000008

Modeling the interactions between stimulation and physiologically induced APs in a mammalian nerve fiber: dependence on frequency and fiber diameter								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE				45	3			193	206		10.1007/s10827-018-0703-y				DEC 2018	2018	Electrical stimulation of nerve fibers is used as a therapeutic tool to treat neurophysiological disorders. Despite efforts to model the effects of stimulation, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Current mechanistic models quantify the effects that the electrical field produces near the fiber but do not capture interactions between action potentials (APs) initiated by stimulus and APs initiated by underlying physiological activity. In this study, we aim to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency and fiber diameter on AP interactions involving collisions and loss of excitability. We constructed a mechanistic model of a myelinated nerve fiber receiving two inputs: the underlying physiological activity at the terminal end of the fiber, and an external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We define conduction reliability as the percentage of physiological APs that make it to the somatic end of the nerve fiber. At low input frequencies, conduction reliability is greater than 95% and decreases with increasing frequency due to an increase in AP interactions. Conduction reliability is less sensitive to fiber diameter and only decreases slightly with increasing fiber diameter. Finally, both the number and type of AP interactions significantly vary with both input frequencies and fiber diameter. Modeling the interactions between APs initiated by stimulus and APs initiated by underlying physiological activity in a nerve fiber opens opportunities towards understanding mechanisms of electrical stimulation therapies.																		0929-5313	1573-6873		WOS:000454422200003	30443813	
J	Stroman, Patrick W.; Ioachim, Gabriela; Powers, Jocelyn M.; Staud, Roland; Pukall, Caroline								Pain processing in the human brainstem and spinal cord before, during, and after the application of noxious heat stimuli								PAIN				159	10			2012	2020		10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001302				OCT 2018	2018	Descending regulation of spinal cord responses to nociceptive signaling has a strong influence on pain perception. Previous studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have indicated that in addition to reactive responses to nociceptive signals, there is a continuous component to regulation, and that it may vary with differences in pain sensitivity. We hypothesize that this continuous regulation component occurs routinely in fMRI studies before noxious stimulation, as well as during, and after stimulation. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing data from 59 healthy participants in 4 previous fMRI studies in our laboratory using noxious heat stimuli. Analyses included structural equation modeling to identify coordinated blood oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variations between regions (ie, connectivity) and Bayesian regression of BOLD time-series responses in relation to pain ratings and stimulus temperatures. The results demonstrate the periaqueductal gray-rostral ventromedial medulla-spinal cord descending modulation pathway, influenced by input from the hypothalamus, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Connectivity between specific regions is observed to vary in relation to pain sensitivity. The results support the conclusion that homeostatic autonomic control influences the net descending pain regulation, and therefore influences pain sensitivity. The results describe the overall properties of pain processing (specifically pain elicited by heat) in the healthy human brainstem and spinal cord, and mechanisms for variation across individuals. This understanding is expected to be important for studies of how pain processing is altered in chronic pain conditions.																		0304-3959	1872-6623		WOS:000451227100012	29905656	
J	Sun, Xiaojuan; Zeng, Hongyou; Wang, Qingsong; Yu, Qingwen; Wu, Jianxiong; Feng, You; Deng, Peng; Zhang, Hongxing								Glycyrrhizin ameliorates inflammatory pain by inhibiting microglial activation-mediated inflammatory response via blockage of the HMGB1-TLR4-NF-kappa B pathway								EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH				369	1			112	119		10.1016/j.yexcr.2018.05.012				AUG 1 2018	2018	Chronic inflammatory pain is a severe clinical problem that greatly affects patients' quality of life and causes huge economic burden. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation exerts critical roles in the pathogenic progression of inflammatory pain. Recent evidence corroborates the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective efficacy of glycyrrhizin; however, its function in inflammatory pain remains poorly elucidated. In the present study, glycyrrhizin suppressed LPS-induced activation of microglial cell BV2 by inhibiting NO production and expression of microglial marker IBA-1. Intriguingly, LPS-induced high expression and generation of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) was notably reversed by glycyrrhizin pre-treatment. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that high expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in LPS-activated microglia was inhibited following glycyrrhizin. More importantly, restoring HMGB1 expression by recombinant adenovirus vector of Ad-HMGB1 counteracted glycyrrhizin-restrained inflammatory response in microglia upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin dampened the activation of subsequent TLR4-NF-kappa B pathway in LPS-stimulated microglia, which was abrogated by HMGB1 elevation. Furthermore, blocking this pathway by si-TLR4 transfection reversed the effects of HMGB1 overexpression on the inhibitor roles of glycyrrhizin in microglia-triggered inflammation. Additionally, glycyrrhizin administration also alleviated CFA-evoked mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in inflammatory pain model of mice, concomitant with suppression in inflammatory response and microglial activation. Simultaneously, elevation of HMGB1, TLR4 and p65-NF-kappa B protein expression induced by CFA injection was also abrogated after glycyrrhizin. Accordingly, this study reveal that glycyrrhizin may act as a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of inflammatory pain.																		0014-4827	1090-2422		WOS:000436057400013	29763588

We have recently introduced the Regional Personalized Electrode (RePE), a tES electrode fitting the personal cortical folding, that has been able to differentiate the stimulation of close by regions, in particular the primary sensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices, and to personalize tES onto such an extended cortical district. However, neuronavigation on individual brain was compulsory for the correct montage. Here, we aimed at developing and testing a neuronavigation-free procedure for easy and quick positioning RePE, enabling multisession RePE-tES at home. We used off-line individual MRI to shape RePE via an ad-hoc computerized procedure, while an ad-hoc developed Adjustable Helmet Frame (AHF) was used to properly position it in multisession treatments, even at home. We used neuronavigation to test the RePE shape and position obtained by the new computerized procedure and the re-positioning obtained via the AHF. Using Finite Element Method (FEM) model, we also estimated the intra-cerebral current distribution induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) comparing RePE vs. non-RePE with fixed reference. Additionally, we tested, using FEM, various shapes, and positions of the reference electrode taking into account possible small displacements of RePE, to test feasibility of RePE-tES sessions at home. The new RePE neuronavigation-free positioning relies on brain MRI space distances, and produced a mean displacement of 3.5 +/- 0.8 mm, and the re-positioning of 4.8 +/- 1.1 mm. Higher electric field in S1 than in M1 was best obtained with the occipital reference electrode, a montage that proved to feature low sensitivity to typical RePE millimetric displacements. Additionally, a new tES accessory was developed to enable repositioning the electrodes over the scalp also at home, with a precision which is acceptable according to the modeling-estimated intracerebral currents. Altogether, we provide here a procedure to simplify and make easily applicable RePE-tDCS, which enables efficacious personalized treatments.																		1662-453X			WOS:000432604000001	29867308

We recently developed soft neural interfaces enabling the delivery of electrical and chemical stimulation to the spinal cord. These stimulations restored locomotion in animal models of paralysis. Soft interfaces can be placed either below or above the dura mater. Theoretically, the subdural location combines many advantages, including increased selectivity of electrical stimulation, lower stimulation thresholds, and targeted chemical stimulation through local drug delivery. However, these advantages have not been documented, nor have their functional impact been studied in silico or in a relevant animal model of neurological disorders using a multimodal neural interface. Approach. We characterized the recruitment properties of subdural interfaces using a realistic computational model of the rat spinal cord that included explicit representation of the spinal roots. We then validated and complemented computer simulations with electrophysiological experiments in rats. We additionally performed behavioral experiments in rats that received a lateral spinal cord hemisection and were implanted with a soft interface. Main results. In silico and in vivo experiments showed that the subdural location decreased stimulation thresholds compared to the epidural location while retaining high specificity. This feature reduces power consumption and risks of long-term damage in the tissues, thus increasing the clinical safety profile of this approach. The hemisection induced a transient paralysis of the leg ipsilateral to the injury. During this period, the delivery of electrical stimulation restricted to the injured side combined with local chemical modulation enabled coordinated locomotor movements of the paralyzed leg without affecting the non-impaired leg in all tested rats. Electrode properties remained stable over time, while anatomical examinations revealed excellent bio-integration properties. Significance. Soft neural interfaces inserted subdurally provide the opportunity to deliver electrical and chemical neuromodulation therapies using a single, bio-compatible and mechanically compliant device that effectively alleviates locomotor deficits after spinal cord injury.																		1741-2560	1741-2552		WOS:000425347300002	29339580

While there is abundant research on these inhibitory pain pathways in animal models, their relevance in humans remains unclear, largely due to the limited possibility to manipulate selectively these pathways in humans. Hyperekplexia is a rare human disease that is caused by loss-offunction mutations in genes encoding for glycine receptors and glycine transporters. In the present study, we tested whether hyperekplexia patients display altered pain perception or central pain modulation compared with healthy subjects. Seven patients with genetically and clinically confirmed hyperekplexia were compared to 14 healthy age-and sex-matched controls. The following quantitative sensory tests were performed: pressure pain detection threshold (primary outcome), ice water tolerance, single and repeated electrical pain detection thresholds, nociceptive withdrawal reflex threshold, and conditioned pain modulation. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed models. Hyperekplexia patients displayed lower pain thresholds than healthy controls for all of the quantitative sensory tests [mean (standard deviation)]: pressure pain detection threshold [273 (170) versus 475 (115) kPa, P = 0.003], ice water tolerance [49.2 (36.5) versus 85.7 (35.0) s, P = 0.015], electrical single pain detection threshold [5.42 (2.64) versus 7.47 (2.62) mA, P = 0.012], electrical repeated pain detection threshold [3.76 (1.41) versus 5.8 (1.73) mA, P = 0.003], and nociceptive withdrawal reflex [7.42 (3.63) versus 14.1 (6.9) mA, P = 0.015]. Conditioned pain modulation was significantly reduced in hyperekplexia [increase to baseline: 53.2 (63.7) versus 105 (57) kPa, P = 0.030]. Our data demonstrate increased pain sensitivity and impaired central pain modulation in hyperekplexia patients, supporting the importance of glycinergic neurotransmission for central pain modulation in humans.																		0006-8950	1460-2156		WOS:000419619700017	29149236

However, there is a lack of investigation of the relationship between sensory thalamic oscillations and pain relief in patients with neuropathic pain. This study aims to identify the oscillatory neural characteristics correlated with pain relief induced by deep brain stimulation (DBS), and develop a quantitative model to predict pain relief by integrating characteristic measures of the neural oscillations.Approach: Measures of sensory thalamic local field potentials (LFPs) in thirteen patients with neuropathic pain were screened in three dimensional feature space according to the rhythm, balancing, and coupling neural behaviours, and correlated with pain relief. An integrated approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression analysis is proposed to integrate the multiple measures and provide a predictive model.Main results: This study reveals distinct thalamic rhythms of theta, alpha, high beta and high gamma oscillations correlating with pain relief. The balancing and coupling measures between these neural oscillations were also significantly correlated with pain relief.Significance: The study enriches the series research on the function of thalamic neural oscillations in neuropathic pain and relief, and provides a quantitative approach for predicting pain relief by DBS using thalamic neural oscillations.																		0969-9961	1095-953X		WOS:000418877600011	29031639

Gene therapy is a potential strategy for the management of NP. In the present study, we examined the analgesic effect and mechanism of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in vitro and in vivo.MethodsWe examined the proinflammatroy gene changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglia BV2 cells with a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Mechanical stimulation tests were performed five times at 5-min intervals to assess pain thresholds using Von Frey Hair in mice following spared nerve injury (SNI). The glial cell activation of spinal cord was examined by western blotting. Statistical significance was determined by a Tukey's test and a paired t-test.ResultsWe found that recombinant human HGF protein suppressed LPS-induced BV2 cell activation in vitro, marked by the down-regulation of IL-1, IL-6, TNF- and iNOS expression, as well as decrease of nitric oxide production. Moreover, intrathecal injection of naked plasmid encoding HGF gene (pUDK-HGF) significantly attenuated SNI-induced pain behaviors in mice by direct inhibition of spinal cord microglia and astrocyte activation.ConclusionsThe results of the present study indicate that pUDK-HGF can reduce cytotoxicity products released from activated glial cells, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for treating NP.																		1099-498X	1521-2254		WOS:000418422700002	29059509

MRI-guided and MRI-verified electrode implantation was performed unilaterally in 5 patients and bilaterally in 2. Volumes of tissue activation were generated around active lead contacts with a finite-element model. Twelve months after surgery, voxel-based morphometry was used to identify voxels associated with higher reduction in headache load. Probabilistic tractography was used to identify the brain connectivity of the activation volumes in responders, defined as patients with a reduction of >= 30% in headache load.Results: There was no surgical morbidity. Average follow-up was 34 +/- 14 months. Patients showed reductions of 76 +/- 33% in headache load, 46 +/- 41% in attack severity, 58 +/- 41% in headache frequency, and 51 +/- 46% in attack duration at the last follow-up. Six patients responded to treatment. Greatest reduction in headache load was associated with activation in an area cantered at 6 mm lateral, 2 mm posterior, and 1 mm inferior to the midcommissural point of the third ventricle. Average responders' activation volume lay on the trigeminohypothalamic tract, connecting the trigeminal system and other brainstem nuclei associated with nociception and pain modulation with the hypothalamus, and the prefrontal and mesial temporal areas.Conclusions: We identify the optimal stimulation site and structural connectivity of the deep brain stimulation target for cluster headache, explicating possible mechanisms of action and disease pathophysiology.																		0028-3878	1526-632X		WOS:000417676500011	29030455

Quantitative models of feline lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia neuronal cell density								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS				290				116	124		10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.07.018				OCT 1 2017	2017	BACKGROUND:Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are spinal root components that contain the cell bodies of converging primary sensory neurons. DRG are becoming a therapeutic target for electrical neural interfaces. Our purpose was to establish methods for quantifying the non-random nature and distribution of neuronal cell bodies within DRG.NEW METHOD:We identified neuronal cell body locations in 26 feline lumbosacral DRG cross-section histological images and used computational tools to quantify spatial trends. We first analyzed spatial randomness using the nearest-neighbor distance method. Next we overlaid a 6X6 grid, modeling neuronal cellular density in each grid square and comparing regions statistically. Finally we transformed DRG onto a polar map and calculated neuronal cellular density in annular sectors. We used a recursive partition model to determine regions of high and low density, and validated the model statistically.RESULTS:We found that the arrangement of neuronal cell bodies at the widest point of DRG is distinctly non-random with concentration in particular regions. The grid model suggested a radial trend in density, with increasing density toward the outside of the DRG. The polar transformation model showed that the highest neuronal cellular density is in the outer 23.9% radially and the dorsal +/- 61.4 degrees angularly.COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS:To our knowledge, DRG neuronal cell distribution has not been previously quantified.CONCLUSIONS:These results confirm and expand quantitatively on the existing understanding of DRG anatomy. Our methods can be useful for analyzing the distribution of cellular components of other neural structures orexpanding to three-dimensional models.Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Electromyographic activation reveals cortical and sub-cortical dissociation during emergence from general anesthesia								JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING				31	4			813	823		10.1007/s10877-016-9911-z				AUG 2017	2017	During emergence from anesthesia patients regain their muscle tone (EMG). In a typical population of surgical patients the actual volatile gas anesthetic concentrations in the brain (C(e)MAC) at which EMG activation occurs remains unknown, as is whether EMG activation at higher C(e)MACs is correlated with subsequent severe pain, or with cortical activation. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and EMG activity was recorded from the forehead of 273 patients emerging from general anesthesia following surgery. We determined C(e)MAC at time of EMG activation and at return of consciousness. Pain was assessed immediately after return of consciousness using an 11 point numerical rating scale. The onset of EMG activation during emergence was associated with neither discernible muscle movement nor with the presence of exogenous stimulation in half the patients. EMG activation could be modelled as two distinct processes; termed high- and low-C(e)MAC (occurring higher or lower than 0.07 C(e)MAC). Low-C(e)MAC activation was typically associated with simultaneous EMG activation and consciousness, and the presence of a laryngeal mask. In contrast, high-C(e)MAC EMG activation occurred independently of return of consciousness, and was not associated with severe post-operative pain, but was more common in the presence of an endotracheal tube. Patients emerging from general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube in place are more likely to have an EMG activation at higher C(e)MAC concentrations. These activations are not associated with subsequent high-pain, nor with cortical arousal, as evidenced by continuing delta waves in the EEG. Conversely, patients emerging from general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask demonstrate marked neural inertia-EMG activation occurs at a low C(e)MAC, and is closely temporally associated with return of consciousness.																		1387-1307	1573-2614		WOS:000405018900020	27444893	
J	Jankowska, Elzbieta; Kaczmarek, Dominik; Bolzoni, Francesco; Hammar, Ingela								Long-lasting increase in axonal excitability after epidurally applied DC								JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				118	2			1210	1220		10.1152/jn.00148.2017				AUG 2017	2017	Effects of direct current (DC) on nerve fibers have primarily been investigated during or just after DC application. However, locally applied cathodal DC was recently demonstrated to increase the excitability of intraspinal preterminal axonal branches for >1 h. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether DC evokes a similarly long-lasting increase in the excitability of myelinated axons within the dorsal columns. The excitability of dorsal column fibers stimulated epidurally was monitored by recording compound action potentials in peripheral nerves in acute experiments in deeply anesthetized rats. The results show that 1) cathodal polarization (0.8-1.0 mu A) results in a severalfold increase in the number of epidurally activated fibers and 2) the increase in the excitability appears within seconds, 3) lasts for >1 h, and 4) is activity independent, as it does not require fiber stimulation during the polarization. These features demonstrate an unexplored form of plasticity of myelinated fibers and indicate the conditions under which it develops. They also suggest that therapeutic effects of epidural stimulation may be significantly enhanced if it is combined with DC polarization. In particular, by using DC to increase the number of fibers activated by low-intensity epidural stimuli, the low clinical tolerance to higher stimulus intensities might be overcome. The activity independence of long-lasting DC effects would also allow the use of only brief periods of DC polarization preceding epidural stimulation to increase the effect.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The study indicates a new form of plasticity of myelinated fibers. The differences in time course of DC-evoked increases in the excitability of myelinated nerve fibers in the dorsal columns and in preterminal axonal branches suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in them. The results show that combining epidural stimulation and transspinal DC polarization may dramatically improve their outcome and result in more effective pain control and the return of impaired motor functions.																		0022-3077	1522-1598		WOS:000408102700045	28515284

Literature review.Objective. A review of the literature that presents a perspective on mechanisms of actions behind spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy for chronic pain.Summary of Background Data. SCS is an effective therapeutic alternative for the treatment of intractable chronic pain. Its application has been mostly based on the gate control theory of pain. Computational models have been fundamental on the understanding of clinical observations and the design of therapies that provide optimal neuromodulation. Research has provided insight into the involvement of specific neurotransmitters that support segmental and supraspinal mechanisms of action.Methods. A literature review was performed with emphasis on mechanisms of action for SCS including the effects of electrical fields on spinal cord structures based on computational models and preclinical and clinical explorations.Results. This review provides background on the development of SCS, which has been driven around a paresthesia-based paradigm as a result of the gate control theory. A review of computational models emphasizes their importance on our current understanding of the mechanism of action and clinical optimization of therapy. Electrophysiology and molecular biology have provided a closer, yet narrow, view of the effect of SCS on neurotransmitters and their receptors, which have led to the formulation of segmental and supraspinal mechanisms. Literature supporting the involvement of glial cells in chronic pain and their characteristic response to electrical fields should motivate further investigation of mechanisms involving neuroglia. Finally, a review of recent results paresthesia-free strategies should encourage research on mechanisms of action.Conclusion. The mechanisms of SCS have been extensively studied and several consistent phenomena have emerged. The activation of A-beta fibers to induce paresthesia also involve neurotransmitter release via segmental and supraspinal pathways. Despite advancements, much remains to be understood, particularly as new stimulation strategies are developed.																		0362-2436	1528-1159		WOS:000415855000004	28368982	
J	Piche, Mathieu; Paquette, Thierry; Leblond, Hugues								TIGHT NEUROVASCULAR COUPLING IN THE SPINAL CORD DURING NOCICEPTIVE STIMULATION IN INTACT AND SPINAL RATS								NEUROSCIENCE				355				1	8		10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.04.038				JUL 4 2017	2017	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is based on neurovascular coupling, which allows inferring neuronal activity from hemodynamic changes. Spinal fMRI has been used to examine pain processes, although spinal neurovascular coupling has never been investigated. In addition, fluctuations in mean arterial pressure (MAP) occur during nociceptive stimulation and this may affect neurovascular coupling. The objective of this study was to examine neurovascular coupling in the rat spinal cord during nociceptive stimulation while MAP was manipulated by cervical spinal transection, which prevents nociception-related MAP increases. Six male Wistar rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.2-1.5%). Local field potentials (LFP) and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) were recorded concurrently in the lumbar enlargement, where activity was evoked by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. In intact conditions, stimulation of graded intensity produced proportional changes in SCBF and LFP that were paralleled by similar changes in MAP. However, spinal transection almost abolished MAP changes (p < 0.001), while SCBF and LFP responses were not significantly affected (p > 0.3) and remained similarly coupled before and after spinal transection. This indicates that spinal hemodynamic changes reflect neuronal activity even when large fluctuations in MAP occur. This contrasts with results from previous studies on cerebral neurovascular coupling and suggests that spinal autoregulation might allow better adaptation to sudden MAP changes than cerebral autoregulation. Although assessment of the coupling between spinal neuronal activity and BOLD signal remains to be investigated, this study supports the use of spinal fMRI, based on the tight coupling between SCBF and LFP.

MAPPING OF PAIN CIRCUITRY IN EARLY POST-NATAL DEVELOPMENT USING MANGANESE-ENHANCED MRI IN RATS								NEUROSCIENCE				352				180	189		10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.03.052				JUN 3 2017	2017	Premature or ill full-term infants are subject to a number of noxious procedures as part of their necessary medical care. Although we know that human infants show neural changes in response to such procedures, we know little of the sensory or affective brain circuitry activated by pain. In rodent models, the focus has been on spinal cord and, more recently, midbrain and medulla. The present study assesses activation of brain circuits using manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). Uptake of manganese, a paramagnetic contrast agent that is transported across active synapses and along axons, was measured in response to a hindpaw injection of dilute formalin in 12-day-old rat pups, the age at which rats begin to show aversion learning and which is roughly the equivalent of full-term human infants. Formalin induced the oft-reported biphasic response at this age and induced a conditioned aversion to cues associated with its injection, thus demonstrating the aversiveness of the stimulation. Morphometric analyses, structural equation modeling and co-expression analysis showed that limbic and sensory paths were activated, the most prominent of which were the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hypothalamus, several brainstem structures, and the cerebellum. Therefore, both sensory and affective circuits, which are activated by pain in the adult, can also be activated by noxious stimulation in 12-day-old rat pups. (C) 2017 IBRO.

J	Choi, Yoon-Hee; Lee, Shi-Uk								Enhancement of brain plasticity and recovery of locomotive function after lumbar spinal cord stimulation in combination with gait training with partial weight support in rats with cerebral ischemia								BRAIN RESEARCH				1662				31	38		10.1016/j.brainres.2017.02.017				MAY 1 2017	2017	Lumbar spinal cord stimulation (LSCS) is reportedly effective for the recovery of locomotive intraspinal neural network, motor cortex and basal ganglia in animals with complete spinal cord injury and parkinsonism. We evaluated the effect of LSCS in combination with gait training on the recovery of locomotive function and brain plasticity using a rat model of brain ischemia. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats with ischemia were randomly assigned into one of four groups: sham treatment (group 1), LSCS only (group 2), LSCS with gait training and 50% (group 3) and 80% (group 4) of body weight support. Evaluations before randomization and 4 weeks after intervention included motor scoring index, real-time PCR and Western blot. Motor scoring index was significantly improved after the intervention in groups 2 and 3. The ratio of phospho-protein kinase C (PKC) to PKC measured in the infarcted area tended to be higher in groups 3 and 4. Protein expression of mGluR2 and mRNA expression of mGluR1 measured in the contralateral cortex were lower in groups 3 and 4. The ratio of phospho-Akt to Akt and mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor measured in the ischemic border zone were higher in group 2. The mRNA expression of MAP1b measured in the infarcted area was significantly higher in group 2. The findings suggest that LSCS and gait training with an adequate amount of body weight support may promote brain plasticity and facilitate the functional recovery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the modulatory effects of stimulation frequency are not only determined by its absolute value but also by other parameters such as power at harmonics. The stimulus pulse shape further influences parameters such as excitation threshold and fiber selectivity. The explicit role of the power in these harmonics in determining the outcome of stimulation has not previously been analyzed. In this study, we adopted an animal model of peripheral electrical stimulation that includes an amplitude-adapted pulse train which induces force enhancements with a corticospinal contribution. We report that the electrical-stimulation-induced force enhancements were correlated with the amplitude of stimulation power harmonics during the amplitude-adapted pulse train. In an exploratory analysis, different levels of correlation were observed between force enhancement and power harmonics of 20-80 Hz (r = 0.4247, p = 0.0243), 100-180 Hz (r = 0.5894, p = 0.0001), 200-280 Hz (r = 0.7002, p < 0.0001), 300-380 Hz (r = 0.7449, p < 0.0001), 400-480 Hz (r = 0.7906, p < 0.0001), 500-600 Hz (r = 0.7717, p < 0.0001), indicating a trend of increasing correlation, specifically at higher order frequency power harmonics. This is a pilot, but important first demonstration that power at high order harmonics in the frequency spectrum of electrical stimulation pulses may contribute to neuromodulation, thus warrant explicit attention in therapy design and analysis.																		2045-2322			WOS:000396285500001	28256638	
J	Shamji, Mohammed F.; De Vos, Cecile; Sharan, Ashwini								The Advancing Role of Neuromodulation for the Management of Chronic Treatment-Refractory Pain								NEUROSURGERY				80	3			S108	S113		10.1093/neuros/nyw047			S	MAR 2017	2017	Neuropathic pain is a common cause of disability and health care utilization. While judicious pharmacotherapy and management of comorbid psychological distress can provide for improved quality of life, some patients with treatment-refractory disease require more invasive therapies. Spinal cord stimulation can provide for improvement in pain and decrease in medication utilization, with level 1 evidence supporting its use across various pain etiologies including persistent postoperative neuropathic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, chronic inoperable limb ischemia, treatment refractory angina, and painful diabetic neuropathy. These procedures can be done with acceptably low morbidity and provide a cost-effective solution for those patients in whom medical therapies have failed. Technological innovation in lead design, implantable pulse generator capability, and stimulation algorithms and parameters may further enhance the success of this therapy. Neuromodulation of distal targets such as dorsal root ganglion may permit greater anatomic specificity of the therapy, whereas subthreshold stimulation with high-frequency or burst energy delivery may eliminate noxious and off-target paresthesiae. Such new technologies should be subject to rigorous evaluation as their mechanisms of action and long-term outcomes remain hitherto undefined.																		0148-396X	1524-4040		WOS:000404513800012	28350939

Here, we briefly review what is known about the relationship between pain and the sleep-wake cycle in humans and laboratory rodents in an effort to identify constraints for the models. While it is well accepted that sleep behavior is regulated by a daily (circadian) timekeeping system and homeostatic sleep drive, the joint modulation of these two primary biological processes on pain sensitivity has not been considered. Under experimental conditions, pain sensitivity varies across the 24 h day, with highest sensitivity occurring during the evening in humans. Pain sensitivity is also modulated by sleep behavior, with pain sensitivity increasing in response to the build-up of homeostatic sleep pressure following sleep deprivation or sleep disruption. To explore the interaction between these two biological processes using modeling, we first compare the magnitude of their effects across a variety of experimental pain studies in humans. To do this comparison, we normalize the results from experimental pain studies relative to the range of physiologically meaningful stimulation levels. Following this normalization, we find that the estimated impact of the daily rhythm and of sleep deprivation on experimental pain measurements is surprisingly consistent across different pain modalities. We also review evidence documenting the impact of circadian rhythms and sleep deprivation on the neural circuitry in the spinal cord underlying pain sensation. The characterization of sleep-dependent and circadian influences on pain sensitivity in this review paper is used to develop and constrain the mathematical models introduced in the two companion articles.

In this article, we introduce mathematical models of the neural circuitry in the dorsal horn responsible for processing nerve fiber inputs from noxious stimulation of peripheral tissues and generating the resultant pain signal. The differential equation models describe the average firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations, as well as the wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons whose output correlates with the pain signal. The temporal profile of inputs on the different afferent nerve fibers that signal noxious and innocuous stimulation and the excitability properties of the included neuronal populations are constrained by experimental results. We consider models for the spinal cord circuit in isolation and when top-down inputs from higher brain areas that modulate pain processing are included. We validate the models by replicating experimentally observed phenomena of A fiber inhibition of pain and wind-up. We then use the models to investigate mechanisms for the observed phase shift in circadian rhythmicity of pain that occurs with neuropathic pain conditions. Our results suggest that changes in neuropathic pain rhythmicity can occur through dysregulation of inhibition within the dorsal horn circuit.

In dorsal horn neurons (DHNs), short-term sensitization can be monitored through the study of wind-up. Wind-up, a progressive increase in DHNs response following repetitive peripheral stimulations, depends on the post-synaptic L-type calcium channels. In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, two L-type calcium channels are present, Cav1.2 and Cav1.3, each displaying specific kinetics and spatial distribution. In the present study, we used a mathematical model of DHNs in which we integrated the specific patterns of expression of each Cav subunits. This mathematical approach reveals that Cav1.3 is necessary for the onset of wind-up, whereas Cav1.2 is not and that synaptically triggered wind-up requires NMDA receptor activation. We then switched to a biological preparation in which we knocked down Cav subunits and confirmed the prominent role of Cav1.3 in both naive and spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathy (SNL). Interestingly, although a clear mechanical allodynia dependent on Cav1.2 expression was observed after SNL, the amplitude of wind-up was decreased. These results were confirmed with our model when adapting Cav1.3 conductance to the changes observed after SNL. Finally, our mathematical approach predicts that, although wind-up amplitude is decreased in SNL, plateau potentials are not altered, suggesting that plateau and wind-up are not fully equivalent. Wind-up and long-term hyperexcitability of DHNs are differentially controlled by Cav1.2 and Cav1.3, therefore confirming that short- and long-term sensitization are two different phenomena triggered by distinct mechanisms.																		0022-3751	1469-7793		WOS:000389029900017	27231046

A Closed Loop Brain-machine Interface for Epilepsy Control Using Dorsal Column Electrical Stimulation								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				6						32814	10.1038/srep32814				SEP 8 2016	2016	Although electrical neurostimulation has been proposed as an alternative treatment for drug-resistant cases of epilepsy, current procedures such as deep brain stimulation, vagus, and trigeminal nerve stimulation are effective only in a fraction of the patients. Here we demonstrate a closed loop brain-machine interface that delivers electrical stimulation to the dorsal column (DCS) of the spinal cord to suppress epileptic seizures. Rats were implanted with cortical recording microelectrodes and spinal cord stimulating electrodes, and then injected with pentylenetetrazole to induce seizures. Seizures were detected in real time from cortical local field potentials, after which DCS was applied. This method decreased seizure episode frequency by 44% and seizure duration by 38%. We argue that the therapeutic effect of DCS is related to modulation of cortical theta waves, and propose that this closed-loop interface has the potential to become an effective and semi-invasive treatment for refractory epilepsy and other neurological disorders.																		2045-2322			WOS:000382643600001	27605389

Changes in Pain Processing in the Spinal Cord and Brainstem after Spinal Cord Injury Characterized by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging								JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA				33	15			1450	1460		10.1089/neu.2015.4257				AUG 1 2016	2016	Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has a number of devastating consequences, including high prevalence of chronic pain and altered pain sensitivity. The causes of altered pain states vary depending on the injury and are difficult to diagnose and treat. A better understanding of pain mechanisms after SCI is expected to lead to better diagnostic capabilities and improved treatments. We therefore applied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brainstem and spinal cord in a group of participants with previous traumatic SCI to characterize changes in pain processing as a result of their injuries. The same thermal stimulus was applied to the medial palm (C8 dermatome) as a series of repeated brief noxious thermal pulses in a group of 16 participants with a cervical (n = 14) and upper thoracic (n = 2) injuries. Functional MRI of the brainstem and spinal cord was used to determine the neuronal activity evoked by the noxious stimulation, and connectivity between regions was characterized with structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that pain ratings, the location and magnitude of blood oxygenation-level dependent fMRI results, and connectivity assessed with SEM varied widely across participants. However, the results varied in relation to the perceived pain and the level/severity of injuries, particularly in terms of hypothalamus connectivity with other regions, and descending modulation via the periaqueductal gray matter-rostral ventromedial medulla-cord pathway. The results, therefore, appear to provide sensitive indicators of each individual's pain response, and information about the mechanisms of altered pain sensitivity. The ability to characterize changes in pain processing in individuals with SCI represents a significant technological advance.																		0897-7151	1557-9042		WOS:000380816200006	26801315

Pain relief using PNFS is dependent on activation of non-nociceptive A-fibers. However, PNFS may also activate muscles, causing twitches and discomfort. In this study, we developed a mathematical model, to investigate the activation of sensory and motor nerves, as well as direct muscle fiber activation.MethodsThe extracellular field was estimated using a finite element model based on the geometry of CT scanned lumbar vertebrae. The electrode was modeled as being implanted to a depth of 10-15 mm. Three implant directions were modeled; horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Both single electrode and between-lead stimulation between contralateral electrodes were modeled. The extracellular field was combined with models of sensory A-nerves, motor neurons and muscle fibers to estimate their activation thresholds.ResultsThe model showed that sensory A fibers could be activated with thresholds down to 0.563 V, and the lowest threshold for motor nerve activation was 7.19 V using between-lead stimulation with the cathode located closest to the nerves. All thresholds for direct muscle activation were above 500 V.ConclusionsThe results suggest that direct muscle activation does not occur during PNFS, and concomitant motor and sensory nerve fiber activation are only likely to occur when using between-lead configuration. Thus, it may be relevant to investigate the location of the innervation zone of the low-back muscles prior to electrode implantation to avoid muscle activation.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000382755300006	27353079

Alfaxalone Anaesthesia Facilitates Electrophysiological Recordings of Nociceptive Withdrawal Reflexes in Dogs (Canis familiaris)								PLOS ONE				11	7					e0158990	10.1371/journal.pone.0158990				JUL 19 2016	2016	Naturally occurring canine osteoarthritis represents a welfare issue for affected dogs (Canis familiaris), but is also considered very similar to human osteoarthritis and has therefore been proposed as a model of disease in humans. Central sensitisation is recognized in human osteoarthritis sufferers but identification in dogs is challenging. Electromyographic measurement of responses to nociceptive stimulation represents a potential means of investigating alterations in central nociceptive processing, and has been evaluated in conscious experimental dogs, but is likely to be aversive. Development of a suitable anaesthetic protocol in experimental dogs, which facilitated electrophysiological nociceptive withdrawal reflex assessment, may increase the acceptability of using the technique in owned dogs with naturally occurring osteoarthritis. Seven purpose bred male hound dogs underwent electromyographic recording sessions in each of three states: acepromazine sedation, alfaxalone sedation, and alfaxalone anaesthesia. Electromyographic responses to escalating mechanical and electrical, and repeated electrical, stimuli were recorded. Subsequently the integral of both early and late rectified responses was calculated. Natural logarithms of the integral values were analysed within and between the three states using multi level modeling. Alfaxalone increased nociceptive thresholds and decreased the magnitude of recorded responses, but characteristics of increasing responses with increasing stimulus magnitude were preserved. Behavioural signs of anxiety were noted in two out of seven dogs during recordings in the acepromazine sedated state. There were few significant differences in response magnitude or nociceptive threshold between the two alfaxalone states. Following acepromazine premedication, induction of anaesthesia with 1-2 mg kg(-1) alfaxalone, followed by a continuous rate infusion in the range 0.075-0.1 mg kg(-1) min(-1) produced suitable conditions to enable assessment of spinal nociceptive processing in dogs, without subjecting them to potentially aversive experiences. This methodology may be appropriate for obtaining electrophysiological nociceptive withdrawal reflex data in client-owned dogs with naturally occurring osteoarthritis.																		1932-6203			WOS:000380169600028	27433936

High-Frequency Stimulation of Dorsal Column Axons: Potential Underlying Mechanism of Paresthesia-Free Neuropathic Pain Relief								NEUROMODULATION				19	4			385	397		10.1111/ner.12436				JUN 2016	2016	Objective: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) treats neuropathic pain through retrograde stimulation of dorsal column axons and their inhibitory effects on wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons. Typical SCS uses frequencies from 50-100 Hz. Newer stimulation paradigms use high-frequency stimulation (HFS) up to 10 kHz and produce pain relief but without paresthesia. Our hypothesis is that HFS preferentially blocks larger diameter axons (12-15 mu m) based on dynamics of ion channel gates and the electric potential gradient seen along the axon, resulting in inhibition of WDR cells without paresthesia.Methods: We input field potential values from a finite element model of SCS into an active axon model with ion channel sub-components for fiber diameters 1-20 mu m and simulated dynamics on a 0.001 msec time scale.Results: Assuming some degree of wave rectification seen at the axon, action potential (AP) blockade occurs as hypothesized, preferentially in larger over smaller diameters with blockade in most medium and large diameters occurring between 4.5 and 10 kHz. Simulations show both ion channel gate and virtual anode dynamics are necessary.Conclusion: At clinical HFS frequencies and pulse widths, HFS preferentially blocks larger-diameter fibers and concomitantly recruits medium and smaller fibers. These effects are a result of interaction between ion gate dynamics and the "activating function" (AF) deriving from current distribution over the axon. The larger fibers that cause paresthesia in low-frequency simulation are blocked, while medium and smaller fibers are recruited, leading to paresthesia-free neuropathic pain relief by inhibiting WDR cells.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000380898300009	27145196	
J	Tan, Daniel; Tyler, Dustin; Sweet, Jennifer; Miller, Jonathan								Intensity Modulation: A Novel Approach to Percept Control in Spinal Cord Stimulation								NEUROMODULATION				19	3			254	259		10.1111/ner.12358				APR 2016	2016	Objective: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can be effective for neuropathic pain, but clinical benefit is sometimes inadequate or is offset by stimulation-induced side-effects, and response can be inconsistent among patients. Intensity-modulated stimulation (IMS) is an alternative to tonic stimulation (TS) that involves continuous variation of stimulation intensity in a sinusoidal pattern between two different values, sequentially activating distinct axonal populations to produce an effect that resembles natural physiological signals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of IMS on the clinical effect of SCS.Methods: Seven patients undergoing a percutaneous SCS trial for postlaminectomy syndrome were enrolled. Thresholds for perception, pain relief, and discomfort were measured and used to create patient-specific models of axonal activation and charge delivery for both TS and IMS. All participants underwent three two-min periods of blinded stimulation using TS, IMS, and placebo, and were asked to describe the effect on quality of the sensory percept and pain relief.Results: All participants perceived IMS differently from placebo, and five noted significant differences from TS that resulted in a more comfortable sensation. TS was described as electric and tingling, whereas IMS was described as producing a focal area of deep pressure with a sense of motion away from that focus. The anatomic location of coverage was similar between the two forms of stimulation, although one participant reported better lower back coverage with IMS. Computer modeling revealed that, compared with TS, IMS involved 36.4% less charge delivery and produced 78.7% less suprathreshold axonal activation.Conclusions: IMS for SCS is feasible, produces a more comfortable percept than conventional TS, and appears to provide a similar degree of pain relief with significantly lower energy requirements. Further studies are necessary to determine whether this represents an effective alternative to tonic SCS for treatment of neuropathic pain.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000374703100006	26479774	
J	Frahm, Ken Steffen; Hennings, Kristian; Vera-Portocarrero, Louis; Wacnik, Paul W.; Morch, Carsten Dahl								Nerve Fiber Activation During Peripheral Nerve Field Stimulation: Importance of Electrode Orientation and Estimation of Area of Paresthesia								NEUROMODULATION				19	3			311	317		10.1111/ner.12371				APR 2016	2016	Introduction and Aim: Low back pain is one of the indications for using peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS). However, the effect of PNFS varies between patients; several stimulation parameters have not been investigated in depth, such as orientation of the nerve fiber in relation to the electrode. While placing the electrode parallel to the nerve fiber may give lower activation thresholds, anodal blocking may occur when the propagating action potential passes an anode.Methods: A finite element model was used to simulate the extracellular potential during PNFS. This was combined with an active cable model of Aa and Ad nerve fibers. Itwas investigated howthe angle between the nerve fiber and electrode affected the nerve activation and whether anodal blocking could occur. Finally, the area of paresthesia was estimated and compared with any concomitant Ad fiber activation.Results: The lowest threshold was found when nerve and electrode were in parallel, and that anodal blocking did not appear to occur during PNFS. The activation of Aa fibers was within therapeutic range (< 10V) of PNFS; however, within this range, Ad fiber activation also may occur. The combined area of activated Aa fibers (paresthesia) was at least two times larger than Ad fibers for similar stimulation intensities.Conclusion: No evidence of anodal blocking was observed in this PNFS model. The thresholds were lowest when the nerves and electrodes were parallel; thus, it may be relevant to investigate the overall position of the target nerve fibers prior to electrode placement.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000374703100022	26586248

Meta-analysis of placebo responses in central neuropathic pain: impact of subject, study, and pain characteristics								PAIN				157	3			530	540		10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000431				MAR 2016	2016	The placebo response is a complex construct related to psychobiological effects, as well as natural history and regression to the mean. Moreover, patient and study design characteristics have also been proposed as significantly affecting placebo responses. The aim of the current investigation was to identify factors that contribute to variable placebo responses in clinical trials involving individuals with central neuropathic pain. To this end, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials examining pharmacological and noninvasive brain stimulation interventions for central neuropathic pain. Study design, subject characteristics, and pain ratings for the placebo group were extracted from each trial. Pooling of results and identification of moderating factors were carried out using random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression techniques. A total of 39 published trials met the inclusion criteria (spinal cord injury, n=26; stroke, n=6; multiple sclerosis, n=7). No significant publication bias was detected. Overall, there was a significant effect for placebo to reduce central pain (-0.64, CI: -0.83 to -0.45). Smaller placebo responses were associated with crossover-design studies, longer pain duration, and greater between-subject baseline pain variability. There were no significant effects for neurological condition (stroke vs multiple sclerosis vs spinal cord injury) or the type of intervention (eg, pharmacological vs noninvasive brain stimulation). In a planned subanalysis, the severity of damage in the spinal cord also had no significant effect on the placebo response. Further study is warranted to identify factors that may explain the impact of pain duration on the placebo response at the individual subject level.																		0304-3959	1872-6623		WOS:000378258800004	26588698

Systemic administration of vitamins C and E attenuates nociception induced by chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve in rats								BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN				121				169	177		10.1016/j.brainresbull.2016.02.004				MAR 2016	2016	Antioxidants have been tested to treat neuropathic pain, and alpha-Tocopherol (vitamin E-vit. E) and ascorbic acid (vitamin C-vit. C) are potent antioxidants. We assessed the effect of intraperitoneal administration of vit. C (30 mg/kg/day) and vit. E (15 mg/kg/day), given alone or in combination, on the mechanical and thermal thresholds and the sciatic functional index (SFI) in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. We also determined the lipid hydroperoxides and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the injured sciatic nerve. Further, we assessed the effects of oral administration of vit. C + vit. E (vit. C + E) and of a combination of vit. C + E and gabapentin (100 mg/kg/day, i.p.) on the mechanical and thermal thresholds of CCI rats. The vitamins, whether administered orally or i.p., attenuated the reductions in the mechanical and thermal thresholds induced by CCI. The antinociceptive effect was greater with a combination of vit. C + E than with each vitamin given alone. The SFI was also improved in vitamin treated CCI rats. Co-administration of vit. C + E and gabapentin induced a greater antinociceptive effect than gabapentin alone. No significant change occurred in TAC and lipid hydroperoxide levels, but TAC increased (45%) while lipid hydroperoxides decreased (38%) in the sciatic nerve from vit. C + E-treated CCI rats. Thus, treatment with a combination of vit. C+ E was more effective to treat CCI-induced neuropathic pain than vitamins alone, and the antinociceptive effect was greater with co-administration of vit. C + E and gabapentin than with gabapentin alone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.																		0361-9230	1873-2747		WOS:000373418900020	26855326

DESCENDING NOCICEPTIVE INHIBITION IS MODULATED IN A TIME-DEPENDENT MANNER IN A DOUBLE-HIT MODEL OF CHRONIC/TONIC PAIN								NEUROSCIENCE				315				70	78		10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.11.065				FEB 19 2016	2016	Clinical evidences suggest that an imbalance between descending inhibition and facilitation drives the development of chronic pain. However, potential mechanisms promoting the establishment of a persistent pain state and the increased pain vulnerability remain unknown. This preclinical study was designed to evaluate temporal changes in descending pain modulation at specific experimental endpoints (12, 28, 90 and 168 days) using a novel double-hit model of chronic/tonic pain (first hit: chronic constriction injury (CCI) model; second hit: tonic formalin pain in the contralateral hindpaw). Basal activity of bulbo-spinal monoaminergic systems was further assessed through liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) screening of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We found that CC-operated rats exhibited a reduced nociceptive response profile, peaking on day 28, when subjected to tonic pain. This behavioral response was accompanied by a rapid increase in basal CSF serotonin and norepinephrine levels 12 days after neuropathy, followed by a return to sham levels on day 28. These molecular and behavioral adaptive changes in descending pain inhibition seemed to slowly fade over time. We therefore suggest that chronic neuropathic pain produces a transient hyperactivation of bulbo-spinal monoaminergic drive when previously primed using a tonic pain paradigm (i.e., formalin test), translating into inhibition of subsequent nociceptive behaviors. Altogether, we propose that early hyperactivation of descending pain inhibitory mechanisms, and its potential ensuing exhaustion, could be part of the temporal neurophysiological chain of events favoring chronic neuropathic pain establishment.

J	Leung, Roxanne H; Stroman, Patrick W								Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Human Brainstem and Cervical Spinal Cord during Cognitive Modulation of Pain.								Critical reviews in biomedical engineering				44	1-2			47	71		10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.2016016541				2016	2016	Pain is a complex sensory experience, and cognitive factors such as attention can influence its perception. Modulation of pain involves a network of subcortical structures; however, the role and relationship of these regions in cognitive modulation of pain are not well understood. The aims of this research were to evaluate the behavioral effect of cognitive modulation of pain and investigate the neural correlates of this mechanism in the brainstem and cervical spinal cord (SC), using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural equation modeling (SEM). We applied noxious thermal stimulation on the C6 dermatome to 12 healthy female participants while they performed the n-Back task. Our findings demonstrate a significant attenuation in pain perception across the group as a result of the task, along with high intersubject variability in the degree of modulation. Using fMRI, our studies characterize neural responses in subcortical regions that are involved in the modulation of pain. SEM analysis reveals connectivity between the brainstem and SC at the group and individual levels, depending on cognitive load and degree of pain modulation, respectively. All together, our research demonstrates the behavioral effect of cognitive modulation on pain and provides insight into the subcortical neural response to the process.																			1943-619X		MEDLINE:27652451	27652451

Critical reviews in biomedical engineering				44	4			227	241		10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.2017020438				2016	2016	Structural equation modeling (SEM) provides a means of investigating relationships between blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes in functional MRI data across neuroanatomical regions. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate adapted SEM methods for the brainstem and spinal cord, validate statistical methods and appropriate statistical thresholds, and test the methods with existing data. SEM methods were applied using an anatomical model of regions of the thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord that are involved with pain processing. Statistical distributions (Z-scores), significance thresholds, and corrections for multiple comparisons were determined from repeated simulations using "null" data sets. SEM analyses were then applied to data from prior studies involving noxious stimulation in healthy participants. Z-score distributions were observed to vary with the number of source regions modeled, the number of time points (volumes) included in the analysis, and the time span (epoch) used for dynamic analyses. Appropriate choices of statistical thresholds and corrections for multiple comparisons were demonstrated. The results reveal consistent network features across/within studies, as well as dependences on study conditions. They show the effectiveness of a SEM method for functional MRI data from the brainstem and spinal cord.																			1943-619X		MEDLINE:29199575	29199575

Neural Correlates of Temporal Summation of Second Pain in the Human Brainstem and Spinal Cord								HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING				36	12			5038	5050		10.1002/hbm.22993				DEC 2015	2015	Temporal summation of second pain (TSSP) occurs when painful stimuli are presented repetitively (>= 0.33 Hz) and results from a C-fibre evoked enhancement (or "wind-up") of the dorsal horn neurons. Based on electrophysiological studies in intact animals, windup is considered a purely central phenomenon. With advancements in functional MRI (fMRI), we can now probe the central mechanisms of this pain response in humans. The aim of this study is to characterize the fMRI responses in the healthy human brainstem and spinal cord that correspond to TSSP. Functional MRI of healthy female adults (N = 15) was conducted while brief, repetitive heat pain stimuli were applied to the right thenar eminence (C6 dermatome), and TSSP (0.33 Hz) and control (0.17 Hz) heat pain paradigms were employed. The stimulus intensity was adjusted to each participant's heat pain sensitivity. Data were analyzed by means of a general linear model, and region-of-interest analyses. As predicted, participants demonstrated significant behavioural summation of pain in the TSSP condition. FMRI results identified enhanced activity in the spinal cord dorsal horn at C6 in response to the TSSP condition. Additionally, multiple areas of the brainstem (RVM and PAG) showed greater responses with the TSSP condition. These results suggest that, in humans, increased pain perception in the TSSP condition is reflected by greater responses in the dorsal horn and in regions known to play a role in the descending modulation of pain, which may modulate the spinal cord response.

Methods: A well-established rat model of trigeminal neuropathic pain involving CCI-IoN was used. Facial mechanical hypersensitivity was tested with non-noxious dynamic mechanical stimulation (air-puff), and the medullary dorsal horn was examined immunohistochemically using PKC gamma and pERK1/2 as pain markers. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Increased PKC gamma and pERK1/2 expressions within the medullary dorsal horn were associated with DMA following CCI-IoN. A segmental network composed of PKC gamma-positive cells located in medullary dorsal horn laminae contacting more superficially located pERK1/2-expressing cells, was identified. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of PKC gamma-y to pERK1/2-positive cells. Moreover, intraciMernal administration of the selective PKC gamma inhibitor KIG31-I blocked both the DMA and pERK1/2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Although the number of pERK1/2-positive cells was significantly elevated with air-puff stimulation, DMA rats not receiving air-puff stimulation showed significant pERK1/2 expression, suggesting they were experiencing spontaneous pain. Conclusion: PKC gamma cells in the medullary dorsal horn may be involved in DMA following CCI-IoN through the activation of pERK1/2-expressing cells, which then may relay nonnociceptive information to lamina I cells in the medullary dorsal horn.																		2333-0384	2333-0376		WOS:000349590700009	25635962

Effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation for the management of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: a meta-analysis								SPINAL CORD				53	11			780	785		10.1038/sc.2015.118				NOV 2015	2015	Objectives: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on reducing neuropathic pain intensity in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).Methods: Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases were searched for all relevant articles published from 1980 to November 2014. Trials were included if (i) tDCS intervention group and a placebo control group were present; (ii) at least 50% of participants in the study had an SCI and there were at least three participants; (iii) participants were aged 18 years or older; and (iv) persistent pain for at least 3 months. Studies were excluded if: (i) the tDCS intervention group was compared with an active treatment group; (ii) there was insufficient reporting detail to enable pooling of data; and (iii) it was a nonclinical trial (that is, reviews, epidemiology, basic sciences). A standardized mean difference (SMD)+/- s.e. and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each outcome of interest and the results were pooled using a fixed or random effects model, as appropriate. Effect sizes were interpreted as: small >0.2, moderate >0.5, large >0.8.Results: Five studies met inclusion criteria of which four were randomized controlled trials and one was a prospective controlled trial. The pooled analysis found a significant effect of tDCS on reducing neuropathic pain after SCI post treatment (SMD=0.510 +/- 0.202; 95% CI, 0.114-0.906; P<0.012); however, this effect was not maintained at follow-up (SMD=0.353 +/- 0.272; 95% CI, -0.179 to 0.886; P<0.194). A reduction of 1.33 units on a 10-item scale was observed post treatment. No significant adverse events were reported.Conclusion: Meta-analytic results indicate a moderate effect of tDCS in reducing neuropathic pain among individuals with SCI; however, the effect was not maintained at follow-up. A mean pooled decrease of 1.33 units on a 10-item scale was found post treatment. Several factors were implicated in the effectiveness of tDCS in reducing pain. Due to the limited number of studies and lack of follow-up, more evidence is required before treatment recommendations can be made.																		1362-4393	1476-5624		WOS:000364808100002	26193817

To our knowledge, no data on the prevalence of spinal nociceptive hypersensitivity are available. We studied the prevalence of pain hypersensitivity and spinal nociceptive hypersensitivity in 961 consecutive patients with various chronic pain conditions. Pain threshold and nociceptive withdrawal reflex threshold to electrical stimulation were used to assess pain hypersensitivity and spinal nociceptive hypersensitivity, respectively. Using 10th percentile cutoff of previously determined reference values, the prevalence of pain hypersensitivity and spinal nociceptive hypersensitivity (95% confidence interval) was 71.2(68.3-74.0) and 80.0 (77.0-82.6), respectively. As a secondary aim, we analyzed demographic, psychosocial, and clinical characteristics as factors potentially associated with pain hypersensitivity and spinal nociceptive hypersensitivity using logistic regression models. Both hypersensitivity parameters were unaffected by most factors analyzed. Depression, catastrophizing, pain-related sleep interference, and average pain intensity were significantly associated with hypersensitivity. However, none of them was significant for both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Furthermore, the odds ratios were very low, indicating modest quantitative impact. To our knowledge, this is the largest prevalence study on central hypersensitivity and the first one on the prevalence of spinal nociceptive hypersensitivity in chronic pain patients. The results revealed an impressively high prevalence, supporting a high clinical relevance of this phenomenon. Electrical pain thresholds and nociceptive withdrawal reflex explore aspects of pain processing that are mostly independent of sociodemographic, psychological, and clinical pain-related characteristics.																		0304-3959	1872-6623		WOS:000364110700030	26172555

This itch sensation is normally suppressed by inputs from mechanoreceptors; however, in many forms of chronic itch, including alloknesis, this gating mechanism is lost. Here we demonstrate that a population of spinal inhibitory interneurons that are defined by the expression of neuropeptide Y::Cre (NPY::Cre) act to gate mechanical itch. Mice in which dorsal NPY::Cre-derived neurons are selectively ablated or silenced develop mechanical itch without an increase in sensitivity to chemical itch or pain. This chronic itch state is histamine-independent and is transmitted independently of neurons that express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. Thus, our studies reveal a dedicated spinal cord inhibitory pathway that gates the transmission of mechanical itch.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000363660000046	26516282

INTER-INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN PAIN PROCESSING INVESTIGATED BY FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING OF THE BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD								NEUROSCIENCE				307				231	241		10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.08.059				OCT 29 2015	2015	The experience of pain is a highly complex and personal experience, characterized by tremendous inter-individual variability. The purpose of this study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize responses in the brainstem and spinal cord to the same heat stimulus in healthy participants, to further our understanding of individual differences in pain perception. Responses to noxious heat stimuli at 49 degrees C were investigated in 20 healthy individuals by means of fMRI of the brainstem and spinal cord, at 3 Tesla, and were compared with brain fMRI and quantitative sensory testing. Blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) responses were detected with a general linear model (GLM) and effective connectivity was examined with structural equation modeling (SEM). Reported pain ratings ranged from 18 to 84/100 across the participants. Consistent with previous research, brain fMRI results show that BOLD responses in a number of cortical regions are correlated with individual pain ratings. Correlations between pain scores and BOLD responses are also demonstrated in the spinal cord dorsal horn, locus coeruleus, and thalamus. SEM results demonstrate the network of brainstem and spinal cord regions that contribute to the pain response, and reveal differences related to individual pain sensitivity. The results of this study are consistent with the conclusion that individual differences in pain perception in healthy participants are a consequence of differences in descending modulation of spinal nociceptive processes from brainstem regions.

Spinal sensory projection neuron responses to spinal cord stimulation are mediated by circuits beyond gate control								JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				114	1			284	300		10.1152/jn.00147.2015				JUL 1 2015	2015	Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a therapy used to treat intractable pain with a putative mechanism of action based on the Gate Control Theory. We hypothesized that sensory projection neuron responses to SCS would follow a single stereotyped response curve as a function of SCS frequency, as predicted by the Gate Control circuit. We recorded the responses of antidromically identified sensory projection neurons in the lumbar spinal cord during 1- to 150-Hz SCS in both healthy rats and neuropathic rats following chronic constriction injury (CCI). The relationship between SCS frequency and projection neuron activity predicted by the Gate Control circuit accounted for a subset of neuronal responses to SCS but could not account for the full range of observed responses. Heterogeneous responses were classifiable into three additional groups and were reproduced using computational models of spinal microcircuits representing other interactions between nociceptive and nonnociceptive sensory inputs. Intrathecal administration of bicuculline, a GABA A receptor antagonist, increased spontaneous and evoked activity in projection neurons, enhanced excitatory responses to SCS, and reduced inhibitory responses to SCS, suggesting that GABA A neurotransmission plays a broad role in regulating projection neuron activity. These in vivo and computational results challenge the Gate Control Theory as the only mechanism underlying SCS and refine our understanding of the effects of SCS on spinal sensory neurons within the framework of contemporary understanding of dorsal horn circuitry.																		0022-3077	1522-1598		WOS:000358010600026	25972582

Computational Analysis of Kilohertz Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation for Chronic Pain Management								ANESTHESIOLOGY				122	6			1362	1376		10.1097/ALN.0000000000000649				JUN 2015	2015	Background: Kilohertz frequency spinal cord stimulation (KHFSCS) is an emerging therapy for treating refractory neuropathic pain. Although KHFSCS has the potential to improve the lives of patients experiencing debilitating pain, its mechanisms of action are unknown and thus it is difficult to optimize its development. Therefore, the goal of this study was to use a computer model to investigate the direct effects of KHFSCS on specific neural elements of the spinal cord.Methods: This computer model consisted of two main components: (1) finite element models of the electric field generated by KHFSCS and (2) multicompartment cable models of axons in the spinal cord. Model analysis permitted systematic investigation into a number of variables (e.g., dorsal cerebrospinal fluid thickness, lead location, fiber collateralization, and fiber size) and their corresponding effects on excitation and conduction block thresholds during KHFSCS.Results: The results of this study suggest that direct excitation of large-diameter dorsal column or dorsal root fibers require high stimulation amplitudes that are at the upper end or outside of the range used in clinical KHFSCS (i.e., 0.5 to 5 mA). Conduction block was only possible within the clinical range for a thin dorsal cerebrospinal fluid layer.Conclusions: These results suggest that clinical KHFSCS may not function through direct activation or conduction block of dorsal column or dorsal root fibers. Although these results should be validated with further studies, the authors propose that additional concepts and/or alternative hypotheses should be considered when examining the pain relief mechanisms of KHFSCS.																		0003-3022	1528-1175		WOS:000363534400020	25822589

S.								Exogenously induced brain activation regulates neuronal activity by top-down modulation: conceptualized model for electrical brain stimulation								EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH				233	5			1377	1389		10.1007/s00221-015-4212-1				MAY 2015	2015	Physiological and exogenous factors are able to adjust sensory processing by modulating activity at different levels of the nervous system hierarchy. Accordingly, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may use top-down mechanisms to control the access for incoming information along the neuroaxis. To test the hypothesis that brain activation induced by tCDS is able to initiate top-down modulation and that chronic stress disrupts this effect, 60-day-old male Wistar rats (n = 78) were divided into control; control + tDCS; control + sham-tDCS; stress; stress + tDCS; and stress + sham-tDCS. Chronic stress was induced using a restraint stress model for 11 weeks, and then, the treatment was applied over 8 days. BDNF levels were used to assess neuronal activity at spinal cord, brainstem, and hippocampus. Mechanical pain threshold was assessed by von Frey test immediately and 24 h after the last tDCS-intervention. tDCS was able to decrease BDNF levels in the structures involved in the descending systems (spinal cord and brainstem) only in unstressed animals. The treatment was able to reverse the stress-induced allodynia and to increase the pain threshold in unstressed animals. Furthermore, there was an inverse relation between pain sensitivity and spinal cord BDNF levels. Accordingly, we propose the addition of descending systems in the current brain electrical modulation model.																		0014-4819	1432-1106		WOS:000351515800003	25665871

J	Sprenger, Christian; Finsterbusch, Juergen; Buechel, Christian								Spinal Cord-Midbrain Functional Connectivity Is Related to Perceived Pain Intensity: A Combined Spino-Cortical fMRI Study								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE				35	10			4248	4257		10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4897-14.2015				MAR 11 2015	2015	The dynamic interaction between ascending spinocortical nociceptive signaling and the descending control of the dorsal horn (DH) by brain regions such as the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) plays a critical role in acute and chronic pain. To noninvasively investigate the processing of nociceptive stimuli in humans, previous fMRI studies either focused exclusively on the brain or, more recently, on the spinal cord. However, to relate neuronal responses in the brain to responses in the spinal cord and to assess the functional interplay between both sites in normal and aberrant conditions, fMRI of both regions within one experiment is necessary. Employing a new MRI acquisition protocol with two separate slice stacks, individually adapted resolutions and parameter settings that are dynamically updated to the optimized settings for the respective region we assessed neuronal activity in the spinal cord and in the brain within one measurement at 3 T. Using a parametric pain paradigm with thermal stimulation to the left radial forearm, we observed BOLD responses in the ipsilateral DH of the spinal segment C6 and corresponding neuronal responses in typical pain-processing brain regions. Based on correlations of adjusted time series, we are able to reveal functional connectivity between the spinal C6-DH and the thalamus, primary somatosensory cortex, bilateral insula, bilateral striatum, and key structures of the descending pain-modulatory system such as the PAG, the hypothalamus, and the amygdala. Importantly, the individual strength of the spinal-PAG coupling predicted individual pain ratings highlighting the functional relevance of this system during physiological pain signaling.																		0270-6474			WOS:000352199900013	25762671	
J	Rigoard, P.; Slavin, K.								Neurostimulation options for failed back surgery syndrome: The need for rational and objective measurements. Proposal of an international clinical network using an integrated database and health economic analysis: The proback network								NEUROCHIRURGIE				61		1		S131	S136		10.1016/j.neuchi.2014.04.003				MAR 2015	2015	Introduction. - In the context of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) treatment, the current practice in neurostimulation varies from center-to-center and most clinical decisions are based on an individual diagnosis. Neurostimulation evaluation tools and pain relief assessement are of major concern, as they now constitute one of the main biases of clinical trials. Moreover, the proliferation of technological devices, in a fertile and unsatisfied market, fosters and only furthers the confusion. There are three options available to apply scientific debates to our daily neurostimulation practice: intentional ignorance, standardized evidence-based practice or alternative data mining approach.Objective. - In view of the impossibility of conducting multiple randomized clinical trials comparing various devices, one by one, the proposed concept would be to redefine the indications and the respective roles of the various spinal cord and peripheral nerve stimulation devices with large-scale computational modeling/data mining approach, by conducting a multicenter prospective database registry, supported by a clinician's global network called "PROBACK".Methods. - We chose to specifically analyze 6 parameters: device coverage performance/coverage selectivity/persistence of the long-term electrical response (technical criteria) and comparative mapping of patient pain relief/persistence of the long-term clinical response/safety and complications occurrence (clinical criteria). Two types of analysis will be performed: immediate analysis (including cost analysis) and computational analysis, i.e. demonstration of the robustness of certain correlations of variables, in order to extract response predictors.Discussion/conclusion. - By creating an international prospective database, the purpose of the PROBACK project was to set up a process of extraction and comparative analysis of data derived from the selection, implantation and follow-up of FBSS patients candidates for implanted neurostimulation. This evaluation strategy should help to change the opinions of each implanter and each health system towards a more rational decision-making approach subtended by mathematical reality.

J	Arguissain, Federico G.; Manresa, Jose A. Biurrun; Morch, Carsten D.; Andersen, Ole K.								On the use of information theory for the analysis of synchronous nociceptive withdrawal reflexes and somatosensory evoked potentials elicited by graded electrical stimulation								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS				240				1	12		10.1016/j.jneumeth.2014.10.011				JAN 30 2015	2015	Background: To date, few studies have combined the simultaneous acquisition of nociceptive withdrawal reflexes (NWR) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). In fact, it is unknown whether the combination of these two signals acquired simultaneously could provide additional information on somatosensory processing at spinal and supraspinal level compared to individual NWR and SEP signals.New method: By using the concept of mutual information (MI), it is possible to quantify the relation between electrical stimuli and simultaneous elicited electrophysiological responses in humans based on the estimated stimulus-response signal probability distributions.Results: All selected features from NWR and SEPs were informative in regard to the stimulus when considered individually. Specifically, the information carried by NWR features was significantly higher than the information contained in the SEP features (p < 0.05). Moreover, the joint information carried by the combination of features showed an overall redundancy compared to the sum of the individual contributions.Comparison with existing methods MI can be used to quantify the information that single-trial NWR and SEP features convey, as well as the information carried jointly by NWR and SEPs. This is a model-free approach that considers linear and non-linear correlations at any order and is not constrained by parametric assumptions.Conclusions: The current study introduces a novel approach that allows the quantification of the individual and joint information content of single-trial NWR and SEP features. This methodology could be used to decode and interpret spinal and supraspinal interaction in studies modulating the responsiveness of the nociceptive system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Paganelli, Meaghan A.; Popescu, Gabriela K.								Actions of Bupivacaine, a Widely Used Local Anesthetic, on NMDA Receptor Responses								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE				35	2			831	842		10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3578-14.2015				JAN 14 2015	2015	NMDA receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission in brain and spinal cord and play a pivotal role in the neurological disease state of chronic pain, which is caused by central sensitization. Bupivacaine is the indicated local anesthetic in caudal, epidural, and spinal anesthesia and is widely used clinically to manage acute and chronic pain. In addition to blocking Na+ channels, bupivacaine affects the activity of many other channels, including NMDA receptors. Importantly, bupivacaine inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, an area critically involved in central sensitization. We used recombinant NMDA receptors expressed in HEK293 cells and found that increasing concentrations of bupivacaine decreased channel open probability in GluN2 subunit-and pH-independent manner by increasing the mean duration of closures and decreasing the mean duration of openings. Using kinetic modeling of one-channel currents, we attributed the observed current decrease to two main mechanisms: a voltage-dependent "foot-in-the-door" pore block and an allosteric gating effect. Further, the inhibition was state-independent because it occurred to the same degree whether the drug was applied before or after glutamate stimulation and was mediated by extracellular and intracellular inhibitory sites, via hydrophilic and hydrophobic pathways. These results predict that clinical doses of bupivacaine would decrease the peak and accelerate the decay of synaptic NMDA receptor currents during normal synaptic transmission. These quantitative predictions inform possible applications of bupivacaine as preventative and therapeutic approaches in chronic pain.																		0270-6474	1529-2401		WOS:000349409300037	25589775

Electrodes are placed to Spinal column's epidural tissue to blocked transfer of pain to brain and to stimulate dorsally column of pain. Today there are two two designs of electrode which are used in Spinal cord stimulation (SCS): a percutaneous (PERC) design, consisting of annular electrodes distributed along a flexible cylindrical shaft, which is inserted with a hypodermic needle; and a laminectomy/paddle design (LAM) implanted during a surgical laminectomy, consisting of a grid of rectangular electrodes on a flexible planar substrate. Also, only controlled percutaneous cathode electrode is used for stimulation a certain area in spinal cord. In this study, numerical studies of direct current application are done using percutaneous lead with 3-electrode model. Spinal canal is modeled in four layers which are epidural fat, CSF, white matter and gray matter tissues as 3D with using Finite Element Method (FEM). The lead with 3-electrode is placed in epidural fat. Anode and cathode electrodes are stimulated so as to flow current respectively 0.25mA and -2mA. At the contact surface of electrodes and epidural fat, obtained maximum current density is 128.161 mA/cm(2) and this value is in the safety limits. The maximum electrical voltage occurred in the spinal canal is 2.133 V and this value is in the interval of perception value for patients.					19th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting (BIYOMUT)19th National Biomedical Engineering Meeting (BIYOMUT)	NOV 05-06, 2015NOV 05-06, 2015		Istanbul, TURKEYIstanbul, TURKEY												978-1-4673-8654-8	WOS:000380507300024

Spragure-Dawley (SD) rats were used for neuropathic pain model of bilateral chronic constriction injury (bCCI) construction. Effects of miR-155 expression on pain threshold of mechanical stimuli (MWT), paw withdrawal threshold latency (PMTL) and cold threshold were analyzed. Target for miR-155 was analyzed using bioinformatics methods. Moreover, effects of miR-155 target gene expression on pain thresholds were also assessed. Compared with the controls and sham group, miR-155 was overexpressed in neuropathic pain rats (P<0.05), but miR-155 slicing could significantly decreased the pain thresholds (P<0.05). Serum and glucocorticoid regulated protein kinase 3 (SGK3) was predicted as the target gene for miR-155, and miR-155 expression was negatively correlated to SGK3 expression. Furthermore, SGK3 overexpression could significantly decreased the pain thresholds which was the same as miR-155 (P<0.05). Moreover, miR-155 slicing and SGK3 overexpression could significantly decrease the painthreshold. The data presented in this study suggested that miR-155 slicing could excellently alleviate neuropathic pain in rats through targeting SGK3 expression. miR-155 may be a potential therapeutic target for neuropathic pain treatment.																		1936-2625			WOS:000368140100061	26823753

IEEE					Electrical neurostimulation for chronic pain: on selective relay of sensory neural activities in myelinated nerve fibers								2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)		IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings						4705	4708						2015	2015	Chronic pain affects about 100 million adults in the US. Despite their great need, neuropharmacology and neurostimulation therapies for chronic pain have been associated with suboptimal efficacy and limited long-term success, as their mechanisms of action are unclear. Yet current computational models of pain transmission suffer from several limitations. In particular, dorsal column models do not include the fundamental underlying sensory activity traveling in these nerve fibers. We developed a (simple) simulation test bed of electrical neurostimulation of myelinated nerve fibers with underlying sensory activity. This paper reports our findings so far. Interactions between stimulation-evoked and underlying activities are mainly due to collisions of action potentials and losses of excitability due to the refractory period following an action potential. In addition, intuitively, the reliability of sensory activity decreases as the stimulation frequency increases. This first step opens the door to a better understanding of pain transmission and its modulation by neurostimulation therapies.					37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015AUG 25-29, 2015	IEEE Engn Med & Biol SocIEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc	Milan, ITALYMilan, ITALY										1557-170X	1558-4615	978-1-4244-9270-1	WOS:000371717204243	26737344

The objective of this work was to investigate the feasibility of using SCS lead impedance for determining the location of a SCS lead and for detecting lead migration, as well as the impact of axial movement and rotation of the St. Jude Medical PENTA (TM) paddle in the dorsal-ventral or medial-lateral directions on dorsal column (DC) stimulation thresholds and neural activation regions. We used a two-stage computational model, including a finite element method model of field potentials in the spinal cord during stimulation, coupled to a biophysical cable model of mammalian, myelinated nerve fibers to calculate tissue impedance and nerve fiber activation within the DC. We found that SCS lead impedance was highly sensitive to the distance between the lead and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) layer. In addition, among all the lead positions studied, medial-lateral movement resulted in the most substantial changes to SC activation regions. These results suggest that impedance can be used for detecting paddle position and lead migration, and therefore for guiding SCS programming.					37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015AUG 25-29, 2015	IEEE Engn Med & Biol SocIEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc	Milan, ITALYMilan, ITALY										1557-170X	1558-4615	978-1-4244-9270-1	WOS:000371717206019	26737610

Electrical stimulation might facilitate plastic changes in affected spinal circuitries that may be beneficial in improving motor function and spasticity or SCI-related neuropathic pain. Based on available animal and clinical evidence, we critically reviewed the physiological basis and therapeutic action of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation in SCI. We analyzed the literature published on PubMed to date, looking for the role of three main noninvasive stimulation techniques in the recovery process of SCI and focusing mainly on transcutaneous spinal stimulation. This review discusses the main clinical applications, latest advances, and limitations of noninvasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. Although most recent research in this topic has focused on transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS), we also reviewed the technique of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) as potential methods to modulate spinal cord plasticity. We also developed a finite element method (FEM) model to predict current flow in the spinal cord when using different electrode montages. We identified gaps in our knowledge of noninvasive electrical stimulation in the modulation of spinal neuronal networks in patients with SCI. tsDCS, TENS, and NMES have a positive influence on the promotion of plasticity in SCI. Although there are no randomized controlled studies of tsDCS in SCI, preliminary evidence is encouraging. FEMs predict that tsDCS electrode montage can be used to shape which spinal segments are modulated and what detailed areas of spinal anatomy can concentrate current density (eg, spinal roots). tsDCS is a technique that can influence conduction along ascending tracts in the spinal cord, so could modulate supraspinal activity. It may also be a promising new approach for a number of neuropsychiatric conditions.																		2324-2426			WOS:000215638500008		
J	Howell, Bryan; Lad, Shivanand P.; Grill, Warren M.								Evaluation of Intradural Stimulation Efficiency and Selectivity in a Computational Model of Spinal Cord Stimulation								PLOS ONE				9	12					e114938	10.1371/journal.pone.0114938				DEC 23 2014	2014	Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an alternative or adjunct therapy to treat chronic pain, a prevalent and clinically challenging condition. Although SCS has substantial clinical success, the therapy is still prone to failures, including lead breakage, lead migration, and poor pain relief. The goal of this study was to develop a computational model of SCS and use the model to compare activation of neural elements during intradural and extradural electrode placement. We constructed five patient-specific models of SCS. Stimulation thresholds predicted by the model were compared to stimulation thresholds measured intraoperatively, and we used these models to quantify the efficiency and selectivity of intradural and extradural SCS. Intradural placement dramatically increased stimulation efficiency and reduced the power required to stimulate the dorsal columns by more than 90%. Intradural placement also increased selectivity, allowing activation of a greater proportion of dorsal column fibers before spread of activation to dorsal root fibers, as well as more selective activation of individual dermatomes at different lateral deviations from the midline. Further, the results suggest that current electrode designs used for extradural SCS are not optimal for intradural SCS, and a novel azimuthal tripolar design increased stimulation selectivity, even beyond that achieved with an intradural paddle array. Increased stimulation efficiency is expected to increase the battery life of implantable pulse generators, increase the recharge interval of rechargeable implantable pulse generators, and potentially reduce stimulator volume. The greater selectivity of intradural stimulation may improve the success rate of SCS by mitigating the sensitivity of pain relief to malpositioning of the electrode. The outcome of this effort is a better quantitative understanding of how intradural electrode placement can potentially increase the selectivity and efficiency of SCS, which, in turn, provides predictions that can be tested in future clinical studies assessing the potential therapeutic benefits of intradural SCS.																		1932-6203			WOS:000348563300025	25536035	
J	Arle, Jeffrey E.; Carlson, Kristen W.; Mei, Longzhi; Iftimia, Nicolae; Shils, Jay L.								Mechanism of Dorsal Column Stimulation to Treat Neuropathic but not Nociceptive Pain: Analysis With a Computational Model								NEUROMODULATION				17	7			642	655		10.1111/ner.12178				OCT 2014	2014	ObjectiveStimulation of axons within the dorsal columns of the human spinal cord has become a widely used therapy to treat refractory neuropathic pain. The mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated and may even be contrary to standard gate control theory. Our hypothesis is that a computational model provides a plausible description of the mechanism by which dorsal column stimulation (DCS) inhibits wide dynamic range (WDR) cell output in a neuropathic model but not in a nociceptive pain model.Materials and MethodsWe created a computational model of the human spinal cord involving approximately 360,000 individual neurons and dendritic processing of some 60 million synapsesthe most elaborate dynamic computational model of the human spinal cord to date. Neuropathic and nociceptive pain signals were created by activating topographically isolated regions of excitatory interneurons and high-threshold nociceptive fiber inputs, driving analogous regions of WDR neurons. Dorsal column fiber activity was then added at clinically relevant levels (e.g., A firing rate between 0 and 110Hz by using a 210-sec pulse width, 50-150Hz frequency, at 1-3V amplitude).ResultsAnalysis of the nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, and modulated circuits shows that, in contradiction to gate control theory, 1) nociceptive and neuropathic pain signaling must be distinct, and 2) DCS neuromodulation predominantly affects the neuropathic signal only, inhibiting centrally sensitized pathological neuron groups and ultimately the WDR pain transmission cells.ConclusionWe offer a different set of necessary premises than gate control theory to explain neuropathic pain inhibition and the relative lack of nociceptive pain inhibition by using retrograde DCS. Hypotheses regarding not only the pain relief mechanisms of DCS were made but also regarding the circuitry of pain itself, both nociceptive and neuropathic. These hypotheses and further use of the model may lead to novel stimulation paradigms.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000345512700005	24750347

RE has been increasingly prescribed for pain relief. However, the endogenous mechanisms underlying this antinociceptive effect are still largely unexplored. Thus, we investigated the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in RE-induced antinociception.METHODS: Male Wistae rats were submitted to acute RE in a weight-lifting model. The nociceptive threshold was measured by a mechanical nociceptive test (paw pressure) before and after exercise. To investigate the involvement of cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids in RE-induced antinociception, cannabinoid receptor inverse agonists, endocannabinoid metabolizing enzyme inhibitors, and an anandamide reuptake inhibitor were injected before RE. After RE, CB1 cannabinoid receptors were quantified in rat brain tissue by Western blot and immunofluorescence. In addition, endocannabinoid plasma levels were measured by isotope dilution-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.RESULTS: RE-induced antinociception was prevented by preinjection with CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptor inverse agonists. By contrast, preadministration of metabolizing enzyme inhibitors and the anandamide reuptake inhibitor prolonged and enhanced this effect. RE also produced an increase in the expression and activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors in rat brain tissue and in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal regions and an increase in endocannabinoid plasma levels.CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that a Single session of RE activates the endocannabinoid system to induce antinociception.																		0003-2999			WOS:000340704600028	24977916	
J	Zhang, Tianhe C.; Janik, John J.; Grill, Warren M.								Modeling effects of spinal cord stimulation on wide-dynamic range dorsal horn neurons: influence of stimulation frequency and GABAergic inhibition								JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				112	3			552	567		10.1152/jn.00254.2014				AUG 1 2014	2014	Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a clinical therapy for chronic, neuropathic pain, but an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying SCS contributes to the lack of improvement in SCS efficacy over time. To study the mechanisms underlying SCS, we constructed a biophysically based network model of the dorsal horn circuit consisting of interconnected dorsal horn interneurons and a wide-dynamic range (WDR) projection neuron and representations of both local and surround receptive field inhibition. We validated the network model by reproducing cellular and network responses relevant to pain processing including wind-up, A fiber-mediated inhibition, and surround receptive field inhibition. We then simulated the effects of SCS on the activity of the WDR projection neuron and found that the response of the model WDR neuron to SCS depends on the SCS frequency; SCS frequencies of 30-100 Hz maximally inhibited the model WDR neuron, while frequencies under 30 Hz and over 100 Hz excited the model WDR neuron. We also studied the impacts on the effects of SCS of loss of inhibition due to the loss of either GABA or KCC2 function. Reducing the influence of local and surround GABAergic interneurons by weakening their inputs or their connections to the WDR neuron and shifting the anionic reversal potential of the WDR neurons upward each reduced the range of optimal SCS frequencies and changed the frequency at which SCS had a maximal effect. The results of this study provide insights into the mechanisms of SCS and pave the way for improved SCS parameter selection.																		0022-3077	1522-1598		WOS:000340837700005	24790169	
J	Sankarasubramanian, Vishwanath; Buitenweg, Jan R.; Holsheimer, Jan; Veltink, Peter								Performance of Transverse Tripoles vs. Longitudinal Tripoles With Anode Intensification (AI) in Spinal Cord Stimulation: Computational Modeling Study								NEUROMODULATION				17	5			457	463		10.1111/ner.12124				JUL 2014	2014	ObjectiveIn spinal cord stimulation, anodes tend to have a strong effect over the area of dorsal column (DC) activation, when configured as both longitudinal guarded cathodes (LGCs) and transverse tripoles (TTs). Inclusion of a small spacing step (LGC+) in the center-center (C-C) spacing of the LGC can be an efficient method to study the local effects around the electrode. The primary aim of this computer modeling study is to investigate if enhanced DC recruitment is achieved when anodal currents in TT and LGC combinations (both LGC and LGC+) are increased up to 30% with respect to the cathodal current. Secondly, the merits of anodal intensification (AI) are evaluated by comparing the DC recruitment areas (S-RA) and energy consumption (E-DT) of LGC+ with AI, against stimulation using an LGC without AI.Materials and MethodsThe commercially available LGC and LGC+, with 4.0 and 4.5mm C-C, respectively, were modeled on a single percutaneous lead at the low-thoracic vertebral region (T10-T12). Transverse tripolar stimulation (TTS) was modeled on triple percutaneous leads.ResultsTTS with 10% AI recruited a smaller S-RA as compared with TTS with no AI. AI of LGC and LGC+ resulted in increasing S-RAs respectively to that of LGC and LGC+ without AI. Also, AI of LGC+ recruited a larger S-RA and usage range (UR) at lower E-DT compared with that of LGC without AI.ConclusionsAI of TTS is not advantageous. LGC and LGC+ with AI allow additional DC stimulation, which may increase the likelihood of activating fibers inaccessible with conventional programming. LGC+ with AI can be more efficient than LGCs without AI, as a larger S-RA and UR is achieved at lower E-DT.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000340270400017	24118284	
J	Zhang, Tianhe C.; Janik, John J.; Grill, Warren M.								Mechanisms and models of spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain								BRAIN RESEARCH				1569				19	31		10.1016/j.brainres.2014.04.039				JUN 20 2014	2014	Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established and cost-effective therapy for treating severe chronic pain. However, despite over 40 years of clinical practice and the development of novel electrode designs and treatment protocols, increases in clinical success, defined as the proportion of patients that experience 50% or greater self-reported pain relief, have stalled. An incomplete knowledge of the neural circuits and systems underlying chronic pain and the interaction of SCS with these circuits may underlie this plateau in clinical efficacy. This review summarizes prior work and identifies gaps in our knowledge regarding the neural circuits related to pain and SCS in the dorsal horn, supraspinal structures, and the Pain Matrix. In addition, this review discusses and critiques current experimental and computational models used to investigate and optimize SCS. Further research into the interactions between SCS and pain pathways in the nervous system using animal and computational models is a fruitful approach to improve this promising therapy.

Materials and Methods The current state of neuromodulation can be viewed in a classical dynamic control framework: the nervous system is the classical plant, the neural stimulator is the actuator, tools to collect clinical data are the sensors, and the physician's judgment is the state estimator and mechanism for closing the therapy feedback loop. This framework highlights the opportunities available to advance neuromodulation. Results Technology has the capability to address key factors limiting the performance of current systems: observability, the ability of the device to monitor the state of the nervous system from sensor-based measurements in real time; and controllability, the ability of the device to drive the nervous system to a desired physiological state using suitable algorithms and actuation. Conclusions Technological advances in neuromodulation using such a control framework have the potential to improve neurologic therapies. Future opportunities for extending the role of these systems are briefly discussed.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000338005800007	24974775	
J	Huang, Qiujun; Oya, Hiroyuki; Flouty, Oliver E.; Reddy, Chandan G.; Howard, Matthew A., III; Gillies, George T.; Utz, Marcel								Comparison of spinal cord stimulation profiles from intra- and extradural electrode arrangements by finite element modelling								MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING				52	6			531	538		10.1007/s11517-014-1157-7				JUN 2014	2014	Spinal cord stimulation currently relies on extradural electrode arrays that are separated from the spinal cord surface by a highly conducting layer of cerebrospinal fluid. It has recently been suggested that intradural placement of the electrodes in direct contact with the pial surface could greatly enhance the specificity and efficiency of stimulation. The present computational study aims at quantifying and comparing the electrical current distributions as well as the spatial recruitment profiles resulting from extra- and intra-dural electrode arrangements. The electrical potential distribution is calculated using a 3D finite element model of the human thoracic spinal canal. The likely recruitment areas are then obtained using the potential as input to an equivalent circuit model of the pre-threshold axonal response. The results show that the current threshold to recruitment of axons in the dorsal column is more than an order of magnitude smaller for intradural than extradural stimulation. Intradural placement of the electrodes also leads to much higher contrast between the stimulation thresholds for the dorsal root entry zone and the dorsal column, allowing better focusing of the stimulus.																		0140-0118	1741-0444		WOS:000336378200003	24771203	
J	Morch, Carsten Dahl; Nguyen, Giang P.; Wacnik, Paul W.; Andersen, Ole Kaeseler								Mathematical Model of Nerve Fiber Activation During Low Back Peripheral Nerve Field Stimulation: Analysis of Electrode Implant Depth								NEUROMODULATION				17	3			218	225		10.1111/ner.12163				APR 2014	2014	ObjectivesThe lower back is the most common location of pain experienced by one-fifth of the European population reporting chronic pain. A peripheral nerve field stimulation system, which involves electrodes implanted subcutaneously in the painful area, has been shown to be efficacious for low back pain. Moreover, the predominant analgesic mechanism of action is thought to be via activation of peripheral A beta fibers. Unfortunately, electrical stimulation also might coactivate A delta fibers, causing pain or unpleasantness itself. The aim of this study was to investigate at which implant depth A beta-fiber stimulation is maximized, and A delta-fiber minimized, which in turn should lead to therapy optimization.Materials and MethodsA finite element model was used to estimate the electrical potential generated by a bipolar single-lead electrode implanted in the subcutaneous adipose tissue at depths of 5 mm to 30 mm below the skin surface. The model includes low back tissue; the epidermis, dermis, adipose, and muscle layers, and nerve fibers, which were programmed to branch randomly in the model in a fiber type-specific manner. Likewise, activation thresholds were specific to A beta- and A delta-fiber types and were estimated using a passive cable model.ResultsThe stimulus-response functions showed that the skin area covered by A beta-fiber activation was larger than the area covered by A delta-fiber activation at all depths and all intensities. The skin area covered by A delta-fiber activation was largest when the electrode was modeled to have a superficial location (5 mm below the skin surface), while the skin area covered by A beta-fiber activation was largest at lower depths.ConclusionsThe present mathematical model predicts an optimal implantation depth of 10 to 15 mm below the skin surface to achieve activation of the greatest area of A beta fibers and the smallest area of A delta fibers. This finding may act as a guide for peripheral nerve field stimulation implant depth to treat low back pain.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000335154500005	24612321	
J	Kilgore, Kevin L.; Bhadra, Niloy								Reversible Nerve Conduction Block Using Kilohertz Frequency Alternating Current								NEUROMODULATION				17	3			242	255		10.1111/ner.12100				APR 2014	2014	ObjectivesThe features and clinical applications of balanced-charge kilohertz frequency alternating currents (KHFAC) are reviewed. Preclinical studies of KHFAC block have demonstrated that it can produce an extremely rapid and reversible block of nerve conduction. Recent systematic analysis and experimentation utilizing KHFAC block have resulted in a significant increase in interest in KHFAC block, both scientifically and clinically.Materials and MethodsWe review the history and characteristics of KHFAC block, the methods used to investigate this type of block, the experimental evaluation of block, and the electrical parameters and electrode designs needed to achieve successful block. We then analyze the existing clinical applications of high-frequency currents, comparing the early results with the known features of KHFAC block.ResultsAlthough many features of KHFAC block have been characterized, there is still much that is unknown regarding the response of neural structures to rapidly fluctuating electrical fields. The clinical reports to date do not provide sufficient information to properly evaluate the mechanisms that result in successful or unsuccessful treatment.ConclusionsKHFAC nerve block has significant potential as a means of controlling nerve activity for the purpose of treating disease. However, early clinical studies in the use of high-frequency currents for the treatment of pain have not been designed to elucidate mechanisms or allow direct comparisons to preclinical data. We strongly encourage the careful reporting of the parameters utilized in these clinical studies, as well as the development of outcome measures that could illuminate the mechanisms of this modality.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000335154500008	23924075

The neural mechanisms underlying the reduction of hyperalgesia and allodynia after MCS are not completely understood.Objective: To investigate the neural mechanisms responsible for analgesic effects after MCS. We test the hypothesis that MCS attenuates evoked blood oxygen-level dependent signals in cortical areas involved in nociceptive processing in an animal model of chronic neuropathic pain.Methods: We used adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10) that received unilateral electrolytic lesions of the right spinal cord at the level of C6 (SCL animals). In these animals, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to study the analgesic effects of MCS. On the day of fMRI experiment, 14 days after spinal cord lesion, the animals were anesthetized and epidural bipolar platinum electrodes were placed above the left primary motor cortex. Two 10-min sessions of fMRI were performed before and after a session of MCS (50 mu A, 50 Hz, 300 mu s, for 30 min). During each fMRI session, the right hindpaw was electrically stimulated (noxious stimulation: 5 mA, 5 Hz, 3 ms) using a block design of 20 s stimulation off and 20 s stimulation on. A general linear model-based statistical parametric analysis was used to analyze whole brain activation maps. Region of interest (ROI) analysis and paired t-test were used to compare changes in activation before and after MCS in these ROI.Results: MCS suppressed evoked blood oxygen dependent signals significantly (Family-wise error corrected P < 0.05) and bilaterally in 2 areas heavily implicated in nociceptive processing. These areas consisted of the primary somatosensory cortex and the prefrontal cortex.Conclusions: These findings suggest that, in animals with SCL, MCS attenuates hypersensitivity by suppressing activity in the primary somatosensory cortex and prefrontal cortex.

J	Fischer, Michael; Carli, Giancarlo; Raboisson, Patrick; Reeh, Peter								The interphase of the formalin test								PAIN				155	3			511	521		10.1016/j.pain.2013.11.015				MAR 2014	2014	The formalin test still surprises with its biphasic pain-related behavior resulting from a quiescent interphase that does not occur with other algogenic compounds and remains unexplained. The first phase has been attributed to TRPA1-mediated excitation of nociceptors, the second phase to their inflammatory and/or spinal sensitization. We show that the second and interphase require higher formaldehyde concentrations to emerge, and that from 12 mM on calcium influx is induced in TRPA1-deficient sensory neurons as well as in native HEK293T cells. After a short depolarizing and excitatory period in a subset, all wild-type neurons showed a concentration-dependent hyperpolarization, a reduction of voltage-activated sodium currents, and a progressive increase of the input resistance, which, after about 10 min restored the transiently lost excitability, enabling smaller and wider action potentials to be evoked than before formaldehyde (30 mM). The hyperpolarizing effect was absent if extracellular sodium was replaced, and largely prevented by a high but not low concentration of tetrodotoxin. In rat skin in vivo, the spatiotemporal redistribution of injected formalin and the plasma extravasation were studied using Evans blue. The parameters gained were entered into a computational model to predict the activation pattern of primary afferents. The model supports a peripherally generated biphasic response, the time course matching the behavioral results. In conclusion, the interphase is a result of hyperpolarization and transient inactivation by formaldehyde of the surviving neurons; their recovery and the centrifugal spread of formalin in the skin induce a second phase of nociceptive activity before the formalin concentration falls below threshold.

IEEE					Computational Modeling Analysis of a Spinal Cord Stimulation Paddle Lead Reveals Broad, Gapless Dermatomal Coverage								2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)		IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings						6254	6257						2014	2014	Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective therapy for treating chronic pain. The St. Jude Medical PENTA (TM) paddle lead features a 4x5 contact array for achieving broad, selective coverage of dorsal column (DC) fibers. The objective of this work was to evaluate DC activation regions that correspond to dermatomal coverage with use of the PENTA lead in conjunction with a lateral sweep programming algorithm. We used a two-stage computational model, including a finite element method model of field potentials in the spinal cord during stimulation, coupled to a biophysical cable model of mammalian, myelinated nerve fibers to determine fiber activation within the DC. We found that across contact configurations used clinically in the sweep algorithm, the activation region shifted smoothly between left and right DC, and could achieve gapless medio-lateral coverage in dermatomal fiber tract zones. Increasing stimulation amplitude between the DC threshold and discomfort threshold led to a greater area of activation and number of dermatomal zones covered on the left and/or right DC, including L1-2 zones corresponding to dermatomes of the lower back. This work demonstrates that the flexibility in contact selection offered by the PENTA lead may enable patient-specific tailoring of SCS.					36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014AUG 26-30, 2014	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol SocIEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc	Chicago, ILChicago, IL										1557-170X		978-1-4244-7929-0	WOS:000350044706062	25571426

With this technique an electrode is implanted in the subcutaneous tissue in the painful area. No specific nerve is isolated and the neural target appears to be the tactile cutaneous nerve fiber branches. In order to understand the neural mechanisms behind PNFS a mathematical model has been proposed. The aim of the present study is to investigate the activation of tactile A beta-fibers and nociceptive A delta-fibers. A finite element model of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue was used to estimate the electrical field generated by two subcutaneously implanted electrodes. The estimated electrical field was used to estimate the activation threshold and location by a stochastically branching nerve fiber model. The model showed that the area of A beta-fiber activation was always larger than the area of A delta-fiber activation. While most electrode configurations provided similar areas of nerve fiber activation, the guarded cathode configuration may be slightly better than the other configurations.					2nd International Conference on NeuroRehabilitation (ICNR)2nd International Conference on NeuroRehabilitation (ICNR)	JUN 24-26, 2014JUN 24-26, 2014		Aalborg, DENMARKAalborg, DENMARK										2195-3562		978-3-319-08072-7; 978-3-319-08071-0	WOS:000391205200085

TLR 2 and 4 Responsiveness from Isolated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from Rats and Humans as Potential Chronic Pain Biomarkers								PLOS ONE				8	10					e77799	10.1371/journal.pone.0077799				OCT 30 2013	2013	Background: Chronic pain patients have increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell Interkeukin-1 beta production following TLR2 and TLR4 simulation. Here we have used a human-to-rat and rat-to-human approach to further investigate whether peripheral blood immune responses to TLR agonists might be suitable for development as possible systems biomarkers of chronic pain in humans.Methods and Results: Study 1: using a graded model of chronic constriction injury in rats, behavioral allodynia was assessed followed by in vitro quantification of TLR2 and TLR4 agonist-induced stimulation of IL-1 beta release by PBMCs and spinal cord tissues (n = 42; 6 rats per group). Statistical models were subsequently developed using the IL-1 beta responses, which distinguished the pain/no pain states and predicted the degree of allodynia. Study 2: the rat-derived statistical models were tested to assess their predictive utility in determining the pain status of a published human cohort that consists of a heterogeneous clinical pain population (n = 19) and a pain-free population (n = 11). The predictive ability of one of the rat models was able to distinguish pain patients from controls with a ROC AUC of 0.94. The rat model was used to predict the presence of pain in a new chronic pain cohort and was able to accurately predict the presence of pain in 28 out of the 34 chronic pain participants.Conclusions: These clinical findings confirm our previous discoveries of the involvement of the peripheral immune system in chronic pain. Given that these findings are reflected in the prospective graded rat data, it suggests that the TLR response from peripheral blood and spinal cord were related to pain and these clinical findings do indeed act as system biomarkers for the chronic pain state. Hence, they provide additional impetus to the neuroimmune interaction to be a drug target for chronic pain.																		1932-6203			WOS:000326334500063	24204973

Recent studies have shown that SCS may also reduce or prevent epileptic seizures, but it is not known which stimulation parameters may be effective. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of several SCS frequencies on seizures induced in rats by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) infusion. The effect was evaluated by analysing electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings. SCS using 0.3 and 0.8 mA biphasic 100/500 mu s pulses delivered at five frequencies was administered in two rats in 60 s stimulation sessions. The present results indicate that 130 and 180 Hz SCS may have anti-epileptic effects and 30 Hz SCS may be pro-convulsive. Further data are needed to validate these results to establish an effective SCS pattern.																		0013-5585	1862-278X		WOS:000497714000276	24042614

Immunofluorescence, ELISA, western blotting and in situ hybridization were used to investigate bilateral changes in IL-6 protein and mRNA in both lumbar (L4-L5) and cervical (C7-C8) dorsal root ganglia (DRG) following CCI. The operated (CCI) and sham-operated (sham) rats were assessed after 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Withdrawal thresholds for mechanical hyperalgesia and latencies for thermal hyperalgesia were measured in both ipsilateral and contralateral hind and fore paws.Results: The ipsilateral hind paws of all CCI rats displayed a decreased threshold of mechanical hyperalgesia and withdrawal latency of thermal hyperalgesia, while the contralateral hind and fore paws of both sides exhibited no significant changes in mechanical or thermal sensitivity. No significant behavioral changes were found in the hind and fore paws on either side of the sham rats, except for thermal hypersensitivity, which was present bilaterally at 3 days. Unilateral CCI of the sciatic nerve induced a bilateral increase in IL-6 immunostaining in the neuronal bodies and satellite glial cells (SGC) surrounding neurons of both lumbar and cervical DRG, compared with those of naive control rats. This bilateral increase in IL-6 protein levels was confirmed by ELISA and western blotting. More intense staining for IL-6 mRNA was detected in lumbar and cervical DRG from both sides of rats following CCI. The DRG removed from sham rats displayed a similar pattern of staining for IL-6 protein and mRNA as found in naive DRG, but there was a higher staining intensity in SGC.Conclusions: Bilateral elevation of IL-6 protein and mRNA is not limited to DRG homonymous to the injured nerve, but also extended to DRG that are heteronymous to the injured nerve. The results for IL-6 suggest that the neuroinflammatory reaction of DRG to nerve injury is propagated alongside the neuroaxis from the lumbar to the remote cervical segments. This is probably related to conditioning of cervical DRG neurons to injury.																		1742-2094			WOS:000319195400001	23634725

LSS pathology is associated with secondary injury caused by inflammation, oxidative damage and cell death. Apart from laminectomy, pharmacological therapy targeting secondary injury is limited. Statins are FDA-approved cholesterol-lowering drug. They also show pleiotropic anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of simvastatin in restoring normal locomotor function after cauda equina compression (CEC) in a rat model of LSS, CEC injury was induced in rats by implanting silicone gels into the epidural spaces of L4 and L6. Experimental group was treated with simvastatin (5 mg/kg body weight), while the injured (vehicle) and sham operated (sham) groups received vehicle solution. Locomotor function in terms of latency on rotarod was measured for 49 days and the threshold of pain was determined for 14 days. Rats were sacrificed on day 3 and 14 and the spinal cord and cauda equina fibers were extracted and studied by histology, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy (EM) and TUNEL assay. Simvastatin aided locomotor functional recovery and enhanced the threshold of pain after the CEC. Cellular Infiltration and demyelination decreased in the spinal cord from the simvastatin group. EM revealed enhanced myelination of cauda equina in the simvastatin group. TUNEL assay showed significantly decreased number of apoptotic neurons in spinal cord from the simvastatin group compared to the vehicle group. Simvastatin hastens the locomotor functional recovery and reduces pain after CEC. These outcomes are mediated through the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of simvastatin. The data indicate that simvastatin may be a promising drug candidate for LSS treatment in humans.																		1557-1890	1557-1904		WOS:000315441900026	23188522

Staggered Transverse Tripoles With Quadripolar Lateral Anodes Using Percutaneous and Surgical Leads in Spinal Cord Stimulation								NEUROSURGERY				72	3			483	491		10.1227/NEU.0b013e31827d0e12				MAR 2013	2013	BACKGROUND: In spinal cord stimulation for low-back pain, the use of electrode arrays with both low-power requirements and selective activation of target dorsal column (DC) fibers is desired. The aligned transverse tripolar lead configuration offers the best DC selectivity. Electrode alignment of the same configuration using 3 parallel percutaneous leads is possible, but compromised by longitudinal migration, resulting in loss of DC selectivity. This loss might be repaired by using the adjacent anodal contacts on the lateral leads.OBJECTIVE: To investigate if stimulation using adjacent anodal contacts on the lateral percutaneous leads of a staggered transverse tripole can restore DC selectivity.METHODS: Staggered transverse tripoles with quadripolar lateral anodes were modeled on the low-thoracic vertebral region (T10-T12) of the spinal cord using (a) percutaneous lead with staggered quadripolar lateral anodal configuration (PERC QD) and (b) laminotomy lead with staggered quadripolar lateral anodal configuration (LAM QD), of the same contact dimensions. The commercially available LAM 565 surgical lead with 16 widely spaced contacts was also modeled. For comparison with PERC QD, staggered transverse tripoles with dual lateral anodes were modeled by using percutaneous lead with staggered dual lateral anodal configuration (PERC ST).RESULTS: The PERC QD improved the depth of DC penetration and enabled selective recruitment of DCs in comparison with PERC ST. Mediolateral selectivity of DCs could not be achieved with the LAM 565.CONCLUSION: Stimulation using PERC QD improves anodal shielding of dorsal roots and restores DC selectivity. Based on our modeling study, we hypothesize that, in clinical practice, LAM QD can provide an improved performance compared with the PERC QD. Our model also predicts that the same configuration realized on the commercial LAM 565 surgical lead with widely spaced contacts cannot selectively stimulate DCs essential in treating low-back pain.																		0148-396X	1524-4040		WOS:000315193800054	23151620

Although SCS has gone through a technological revolution over the last four decades, the neurophysiologic and biochemical mechanisms of action have only been partly elucidated. Animal experimental work has provided some evidence for spinal as well as supraspinal mechanisms of neuropathic pain relief of SCS. A SCS computer model of the electrical properties of the human spinal cord revealed many basic neurophysiologic principles that were clinically validated later on. The main question in clinical SCS is how to further improve the effectiveness of SCS as there is still a significant failure rate of 30%. In this context, experimental studies are needed to elucidate which target pain neuron(s) are involved, as well as with what exact electrical stimulation this target neuron can be influenced to produce an optimal supapression of neuropathic pain. This article reviews the basic clinical and experimental technical aspects in relation to the effectiveness of SCS in view of recent understanding of the dorsal horn pain circuit involved. These data may then result in experiments needed for an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying SCS and consequently lead to improvement and increased effectiveness of SCS in neuropathic pain as a clinical therapy.																		1530-7085	1533-2500		WOS:000314757400008	22780956

IEEE					A Model of Evoked Potentials in Spinal Cord Stimulation								2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)		IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings						6555	6558						2013	2013	Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord is used for pain relief, and is in use for hundreds of thousands of cases of chronic neuropathic pain. In spinal cord stimulation (SCS), an array of electrodes is implanted in the epidural space of the cord, and electrical currents are used to stimulate nearby nerve fibers, believed to be in the dorsal columns of the cord.Despite the long history of SCS for pain, stretching over 30 years, its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and the therapy has evolved very little in this time.Recent work has resulted in the ability to record complex compound action potential waveforms during therapy. These waveforms reflect the neural activity evoked by the therapeutic stimulation, and reveal information about the underlying physiological processes. We aim to simulate these processes to the point of reproducing these recordings.We establish a hybrid model of SCS, composed of a three-dimensional electrical model and a neural model. The 3D model describes the geometry of the spinal regions under consideration, and the electric fields that result from any flow of current within them. The neural model simulates the behaviour of spinal nerve fibers, which are the target tissues of the therapy. The combination of these two models is used to predict which fibers may be recruited by a given stimulus, as well as to predict the ensuing recorded waveforms.The model is shown to reproduce major features of spinal compound action potentials, such as threshold and propagation behaviour, which have been observed in experiments.The model's coverage of processes from stimulation to recording allows it to be compared side-by-side with actual experimental data, and will permit its refinement to a substantial level of accuracy.					35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013JUL 03-07, 2013	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc; Japanese Soc Med & Biol EngnIEEE Engn Med Biol Soc; Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn	Osaka, JAPANOsaka, JAPAN										1557-170X		978-1-4577-0216-7	WOS:000341702106235	24111244

J	Rhudy, Jamie L.; Martin, Satin L.; Terry, Ellen L.; DelVentura, Jennifer L.; Kerr, Kara L.; Palit, Shreela								Using multilevel growth curve modeling to examine emotional modulation of temporal summation of pain (TS-pain) and the nociceptive flexion reflex (TS-NFR)								PAIN				153	11			2274	2282		10.1016/j.pain.2012.07.030				NOV 2012	2012	Emotion can modulate pain and spinal nociception, and correlational data suggest that cognitive-emotional processes can facilitate wind-up-like phenomena (ie, temporal summation of pain). However, there have been no experimental studies that manipulated emotion to determine whether within-subject changes in emotion influence temporal summation of pain (TS-pain) and the nociceptive flexion reflex (TS-NFR, a physiological measure of spinal nociception). The present study presented a series of emotionally charged pictures (mutilation, neutral, erotic) during which electric stimuli at 2 Hz were delivered to the sural nerve to evoke TS-pain and TS-NFR. Participants (n = 46 healthy; 32 female) were asked to rate their emotional reactions to pictures as a manipulation check. Pain outcomes were analyzed using statistically powerful multilevel growth curve models. Results indicated that emotional state was effectively manipulated. Further, emotion modulated the overall level of pain and NFR; pain and NFR were highest during mutilation and lowest during erotic pictures. Although pain and NFR both summated in response to the 2-Hz stimulation series, the magnitude of pain summation (TS-pain) and NFR summation (TS-NFR) was not modulated by picture-viewing. These results imply that, at least in healthy humans, within-subject changes in emotions do not promote central sensitization via amplification of temporal summation. However, future studies are needed to determine whether these findings generalize to clinical populations (eg, chronic pain). (C) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Reduction of physiological noise with independent component analysis improves the detection of nociceptive responses with fMRI of the human spinal cord								NEUROIMAGE				63	1			245	252		10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.06.057				OCT 15 2012	2012	The evaluation of spinal cord neuronal activity in humans with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is technically challenging. Major difficulties arise from cardiac and respiratory movement artifacts that constitute significant sources of noise. In this paper we assessed the Correction of Structured noise using spatial Independent Component Analysis (CORSICA). FMRI data of the cervical spinal cord were acquired in 14 healthy subjects using gradient-echo EPI. Nociceptive electrical stimuli were applied to the thumb. Additional data with short TR (250 ms, to prevent aliasing) were acquired to generate a spatial map of physiological noise derived from Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Physiological noise was subsequently removed from the long-TR data after selecting independent components based on the generated noise map. Stimulus-evoked responses were analyzed using the general linear model, with and without CORSICA and with a regressor generated from the cerebrospinal fluid region. Results showed higher sensitivity to detect stimulus-related activation in the targeted dorsal segment of the cord after CORSICA. Furthermore, fewer voxels showed stimulus-related signal changes in the CSF and outside the spinal region, suggesting an increase in specificity. ICA can be used to effectively reduce physiological noise in spinal cord fMRI time series. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.																		1053-8119			WOS:000308770300026	22776463

Nevertheless, most of the current neurostimulation models are based on open-loop system designs. There is a lack of closed-loop systems for neurostimulation in research with small freely-moving animals and in future clinical applications. Based on our previously developed analog wireless system for closed-loop neurostimulation, a digital wireless system with real-time feedback between recorder and stimulator modules has been developed to achieve multi-channel communication. The wireless system includes a wearable recording module, a wearable stimulation module and a transceiver connected to a computer for real-time and off-line data processing, display and storage. To validate our system, wide dynamic range neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn have been recorded from anesthetized rats in response to graded mechanical stimuli ( brush, pressure and pinch) applied in the hind paw. The identified nociceptive signals were used to automatically trigger electrical stimulation at the periaqueductal gray in real time to inhibit their own activities by the closed-loop design. Our digital wireless closed-loop system has provided a simplified and efficient method for further study of pain processing in freely-moving animals and potential clinical application in patients.																		1741-2560	1741-2552		WOS:000309511200011	22955012

Harnessing pain heterogeneity and RNA transcriptome to identify blood-based pain biomarkers: a novel correlational study design and bioinformatics approach in a graded chronic constriction injury model								JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY				122	5			976	994		10.1111/j.1471-4159.2012.07833.x				SEP 2012	2012	J. Neurochem. (2012) 122, 976994. Abstract A quantitative, peripherally accessible biomarker for neuropathic pain has great potential to improve clinical outcomes. Based on the premise that peripheral and central immunity contribute to neuropathic pain mechanisms, we hypothesized that biomarkers could be identified from the whole blood of adult male rats, by integrating graded chronic constriction injury (CCI), ipsilateral lumbar dorsal quadrant (iLDQ) and whole blood transcriptomes, and pathway analysis with pain behavior. Correlational bioinformatics identified a range of putative biomarker genes for allodynia intensity, many encoding for proteins with a recognized role in immune/nociceptive mechanisms. A selection of these genes was validated in a separate replication study. Pathway analysis of the iLDQ transcriptome identified Fc? and Fce signaling pathways, among others. This study is the first to employ the whole blood transcriptome to identify pain biomarker panels. The novel correlational bioinformatics, developed here, selected such putative biomarkers based on a correlation with pain behavior and formation of signaling pathways with iLDQ genes. Future studies may demonstrate the predictive ability of these biomarker genes across other models and additional variables.																		0022-3042	1471-4159		WOS:000307969700012	22697386

The transition from acute to chronic pain is known to involve the spinal cord (Woolf and Salter, 2000). Therefore, to investigate altered human spinal cord function and translate results obtained from other species, a noninvasive neuroimaging technique is desirable. We have investigated the functional response in the cervical spinal cord of 18 healthy human subjects (aged 22-40 years) to noxious thermal and non-noxious tactile stimulation of the left and right forearms. Physiological noise, which is a significant source of signal variability in the spinal cord, was accounted for in the general linear model. Group analysis, performed using a mixed-effects model, revealed distinct regions of activity that were dependent on both the side and the type of stimulation. In particular, thermal stimulation on the medial aspect of the wrist produced activity within the C6/C5 segment ipsilateral to the side of stimulation. Similar to data recorded in animals (Fitzgerald, 1982), painful thermal stimuli produced increased ipsilateral and decreased contralateral blood flow, which may reflect, respectively, excitatory and inhibitory processes. Nonpainful punctate stimulation of the thenar eminence provoked more diffuse activity but was still ipsilateral to the side of stimulation. These results present the first noninvasive evidence for a lateralized response to noxious and non-noxious stimuli in the human spinal cord. The development of these techniques opens the path to understanding, at a subject-specific level, central sensitization processes that contribute to chronic pain states.																		0270-6474			WOS:000303598900018	22553029	
J	Kong, Yazhuo; Jenkinson, Mark; Andersson, Jesper; Tracey, Irene; Brooks, Jonathan C. W.								Assessment of physiological noise modelling methods for functional imaging of the spinal cord								NEUROIMAGE				60	2			1538	1549		10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.11.077				APR 2 2012	2012	The spinal cord is the main pathway for information between the central and the peripheral nervous systems. Non-invasive functional MRI offers the possibility of studying spinal cord function and central sensitisation processes. However, imaging neural activity in the spinal cord is more difficult than in the brain. A significant challenge when dealing with such data is the influence of physiological noise (primarily cardiac and respiratory), and currently there is no standard approach to account for these effects. We have previously studied the various sources of physiological noise for spinal cord fMRI at 1.5 T and proposed a physiological noise model (PNM) (Brooks et al., 2008). An alternative de-noising strategy, selective averaging filter (SAF), was proposed by Deckers et al. (2006). In this study we reviewed and implemented published physiological noise correction methods at higher field (3 T) and aimed to find the optimal models for gradient-echo-based BOLD acquisitions. Two general techniques were compared: physiological noise model (PNM) and selective averaging filter (SAF), along with regressors designed to account for specific signal compartments and physiological processes: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), motion correction (MC) parameters, heart rate (HR). respiration volume per time (RVT), and the associated cardiac and respiratory response functions. Functional responses were recorded from the cervical spinal cord of 18 healthy subjects in response to noxious thermal and non-noxious punctate stimulation. The various combinations of models and regressors were compared in three ways: the model fit residuals, regression model F-tests and the number of activated voxels. The PNM was found to outperform SAF in all three tests. Furthermore, inclusion of the CSF regressor was crucial as it explained a significant amount of signal variance in the cord and increased the number of active cord voxels. Whilst HR, RVT and MC explained additional signal (noise) variance, they were also found (in particular HR and RVT) to have a negative impact on the parameter estimates (of interest) - as they may be correlated with task conditions e.g. noxious thermal stimuli. Convolution with previously published cardiac and respiratory impulse response functions was not found to be beneficial. The other novel aspect of current study is the investigation of the influence of pre-whitening together with PNM regressors on spinal fMRI data. Pre-whitening was found to reduce non-white noise, which was not accounted for by physiological noise correction, and decrease false positive detection rates. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Models of deep brain stimulation and spinal cord stimulation have advanced over recent decades from simple, stereotyped models to sophisticated patient-specific models that can incorporate many important details of the stimulation system and the attributes of individual subjects. Models have been used to make detailed predictions of the bioelectric fields produced during stimulation. These predictions have been used as a starting point for further analyses such as stimulation safety, neural response, neurostimulation system design, or clinical outcomes.

This chapter presents the infant stage of studies that attempt to explain the mechanisms which come into play for treating neuropathic pain, ischemic pain in peripheral vascular disease, and diseases of the visceral organs, specifically the gastrointestinal tract and the heart.

The role of amputation as an outcome measure in cellular therapy for critical limb ischemia: implications for clinical trial design								JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE				9						165	10.1186/1479-5876-9-165				SEP 27 2011	2011	Background: Autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells have been ascribed an important therapeutic role in No-Option Critical limb Ischemia (NO-CLI). One primary endpoint for evaluating NO-CLI therapy is major amputation (AMP), which is usually combined with mortality for AMP-free survival (AFS). Only a trial which is double blinded can eliminate physician and patient bias as to the timing and reason for AMP. We examined factors influencing AMP in a prospective double-blinded pilot RCT (2: 1 therapy to control) of 48 patients treated with site of service obtained bone marrow cells (BMAC) as well as a systematic review of the literature.Methods: Cells were injected intramuscularly in the CLI limbs as either BMAC or placebo (peripheral blood). Six month AMP rates were compared between the two arms. Both patient and treating team were blinded of the assignment in follow-up examinations. A search of the literature identified 9 NO-CLI trials, the control arms of which were used to determine 6 month AMP rates and the influence of tissue loss.Results: Fifteen amputations occurred during the 6 month period, 86.7% of these during the first 4 months. One amputation occurred in a Rutherford 4 patient. The difference in amputation rate between patients with rest pain (5.6%) and those with tissue loss (46.7%), irrespective of treatment group, was significant (p = 0.0029). In patients with tissue loss, treatment with BMAC demonstrated a lower amputation rate than placebo (39.1% vs. 71.4%, p = 0.1337). The Kaplan-Meier time to amputation was longer in the BMAC group than in the placebo group (p = 0.067). Projecting these results to a pivotal trial, a bootstrap simulation model showed significant difference in AFS between BMAC and placebo with a power of 95% for a sample size of 210 patients. Meta-analysis of the literature confirmed a difference in amputation rate between patients with tissue loss and rest pain.Conclusions: BMAC shows promise in improving AMP-free survival if the trends in this pilot study are validated in a larger pivotal trial. The difference in amp rate between Rutherford 4 & 5 patients suggests that these patients should be stratified in future RCTs.																			1479-5876		WOS:000295825400002	21951607

Dual leads (longitudinal bipole/tripole) provide medio-lateral control over the recruited dorsal column (DC) area by steering the injected cathodal currents. However, the DC recruited area is suboptimal when dual aligned leads straddling the midline programmed as longitudinal guarded cathodes (+-+) are used instead of a single lead placed over the spinal cord midline with the same configuration. As a potential improvement, an additional third lead between the two aligned leads is modeled to maximize the medio-lateral extent of the DCs at the low-thoracic vertebral region (T10-T12).Methods and Materials: The University of Twente Spinal Cord Stimulation software (UT-SCS) is used in this modeling study. Longitudinal guarded cathodes were modeled on the low-thoracic vertebral region (T10-T12) using percutaneous triple lead configurations. The central lead was modeled over the spinal cord midline and the two lateral leads were modeled at several transverse distances to the midline lead. Medio-lateral field steering was performed with the midline lead and the second lead on each side to achieve constant anodal current ratios and variable anodal current ratios.Results: Reducing the transverse lead separation resulted in increasing the depths and widths of the recruited DC area. The triple lead configuration with the least transverse separation had the largest DC recruited area and usage range. The maximum DC recruited area (in terms of both depth and width) was always found to be larger under variable anodal current ratio than constant anodal current ratio conditions.Conclusions: Triple leads programmed to perform as longitudinal guarded cathodes provide more postoperative flexibility than single and dual leads in covering a larger width of the low-thoracic DCs. The transverse separation between the leads is a major determinant of the area and distribution of paresthesia.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000295522000003	21854494

Inhibition of Neuronal Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels by Brilliant Blue G								MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY				80	2			247	257		10.1124/mol.110.070276				AUG 2011	2011	Brilliant blue G (BBG), best known as an antagonist of P2X7 receptors, was found to inhibit voltage-gated sodium currents in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Sodium currents elicited from a holding potential of -60 mV were blocked with an IC50 of 2 mu M. Block was enhanced in a use-dependent manner at higher stimulation rates. The voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction, and recovery from inactivation was slowed by BBG. The most dramatic effect of BBG was to slow recovery from inactivation after long depolarizations, with 3 mu M BBG increasing half-time for recovery (measured at -120 mV) from 24 to 854 ms after a 10-s step to 0 mV. These results were mimicked by a kinetic model in which BBG binds weakly to resting channels (K-d = 170 mu M) but tightly to fast-inactivated channels (K-d = 5 mu M) and even more tightly Downloaded from molpharm. aspetjournals. org at Thomson Scientific on July 15, 2011 (K-d = 0.2 mu M) to slow-inactivated channels. In contrast to BBG, the structurally related food-coloring dye Brilliant Blue FCF had very little effect at concentrations up to 30 mu M. These results show that BBG inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels at micromolar concentrations. Although BBG inhibition of sodium channels is less potent than inhibition of P2X7 receptors, there may be significant inhibition of sodium channels at BBG concentrations achieved in spinal cord or brain during experimental treatment of spinal cord injury or Huntington's disease. Considered as a sodium channel blocker, BBG is remarkably potent, acting with more than 10-fold greater potency than lacosamide, another blocker thought to bind to slow-inactivated channels.																		0026-895X	1521-0111		WOS:000292734900004	21536754

A single-channel LRS system consisted of a light source. CCD-array detector, and a computer along with a bifurcated, 2-mm-diameter optical probe; this system was utilized to perform laboratory tissue phantoms for validation of the algorithms. In the animal study, a multi-channel, multisite approach was used to measure several reflectance spectra from rat brain and spinal cord on both the ipsi-lateral and contra-lateral sides, using thin 800 mu m-diameter optic probes. The neuro-hemodynamic changes were induced by 10-V electrical stimulation in rat hind paw. The LRS data of the animals were analyzed using both absolute and relative methods. The results show that the relative method is computation-efficient and offers a quick estimation of changes in oxy-hemoglobin concentration for real-time monitoring. The absolute quantification method, on the other hand, provides us with an accurate computational tool to calculate absolute values of oxy-, deoxy-, total hemoglobin concentrations, and light scattering coefficients. We also observe that the hemodynamic responses in rat spinal cord were delayed with a few seconds and have an overall broader full width at half maximum, as compared to those from rat somatosensory cortex. LRS as a measurement system provides a robust method for studying local hemodynarnic changes and a potential technique to investigate hemo-neural mechanisms in pain processing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Overall functional studies have lagged behind human studies as a result of technical issues including the use of anesthesia. Now that many of these issues have been overcome including the possibility of imaging awake animals, there are new opportunities to study whole brain systems neurobiology of acute and chronic pain as well as analgesic effects on brain systems de novo (using pharmacological MRI) or testing in animal models of pain. Understanding brain networks in these areas may provide new insights into translational science, and use neural networks as a "language of translation" between preclinical to clinical models. In this review we evaluate the role of functional and anatomical imaging in furthering our understanding in pain and analgesia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Pain catastrophizing is related to temporal summation of pain but not temporal summation of the nociceptive flexion reflex								PAIN				152	4			794	801		10.1016/j.pain.2010.12.041				APR 2011	2011	Pain catastrophizing is associated with enhanced temporal summation of pain (TS-Pain). However, because prior studies have found that pain catastrophizing is not associated with a measure of spinal nociception (nociceptive flexion reflex [NFR] threshold), this association may not result from changes in spinal nociceptive processes. The goal of the present study in healthy participants was to examine the relationship between trait (traditional) and state (situation-specific) pain catastrophizing and temporal summation of NFR (TS-NFR) and TS-Pain. A secondary goal was to replicate prior findings concerning relationships between catastrophizing and NFR threshold, electrocutaneous pain threshold, and sensory and affective ratings of electrocutaneous stimuli. All analyses controlled for depression symptoms, pain-related anxiety, and participant sex. As expected, multiple regression analyses indicated that neither trait nor situation-specific catastrophizing was associated with NFR threshold, but that situation-specific catastrophizing was associated with pain ratings. Multilevel linear growth models of TS data indicated that situation-specific catastrophizing was associated with TS-Pain but not TS-NFR. Trait catastrophizing was not related to TS-Pain or TS-NFR. Together, these results confirm prior studies that indicate that catastrophizing enhances pain via supraspinal processes rather than spinal processes. Moreover, because catastrophizing was associated with TS-Pain but not TS-NFR, caution is warranted when using pain ratings to infer temporal summation of spinal nociceptive processes.

J	Danner, Simon M.; Hofstoetter, Ursula S.; Ladenbauer, Josef; Rattay, Frank; Minassian, Karen								Can the Human Lumbar Posterior Columns Be Stimulated by Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation? A Modeling Study								ARTIFICIAL ORGANS				35	3			257	262		10.1111/j.1525-1594.2011.01213.x				MAR 2011	2011	Stimulation of different spinal cord segments in humans is a widely developed clinical practice for modification of pain, altered sensation, and movement. The human lumbar cord has become a target for modification of motor control by epidural and, more recently, by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation. Posterior columns of the lumbar spinal cord represent a vertical system of axons and when activated can add other inputs to the motor control of the spinal cord than stimulated posterior roots. We used a detailed three-dimensional volume conductor model of the torso and the McIntyre-Richard-Grill axon model to calculate the thresholds of axons within the posterior columns in response to transcutaneous lumbar spinal cord stimulation. Superficially located large-diameter posterior column fibers with multiple collaterals have a threshold of 45.4 V, three times higher than posterior root fibers (14.1 V). With the stimulation strength needed to activate posterior column axons, posterior root fibers of large and small diameters as well as anterior root fibers are coactivated. The reported results inform on these threshold differences, when stimulation is applied to the posterior structures of the lumbar cord at intensities above the threshold of large-diameter posterior root fibers.																		0160-564X	1525-1594		WOS:000288451400018	21401670	
J	Sankarasubramanian, V.; Buitenweg, J. R.; Holsheimer, J.; Veltink, P.								Electrode alignment of transverse tripoles using a percutaneous triple-lead approach in spinal cord stimulation								JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING				8	1					016010	10.1088/1741-2560/8/1/016010				FEB 2011	2011	The aim of this modeling study is to determine the influence of electrode alignment of transverse tripoles on the paresthesia coverage of the pain area in spinal cord stimulation, using a percutaneous triple-lead approach. Transverse tripoles, comprising a central cathode and two lateral anodes, were modeled on the low-thoracic vertebral region (T10-T12) using percutaneous triple-lead configurations, with the center lead on the spinal cord midline. The triple leads were oriented both aligned and staggered. In the staggered configuration, the anodes were offset either caudally (caudally staggered) or rostrally (rostrally staggered) with respect to the midline cathode. The transverse tripolar field steering with the aligned and staggered configurations enabled the estimation of dorsal column fiber thresholds (I-DC) and dorsal root fiber thresholds (I-DR) at various anodal current ratios. I-DC and I-DR were considerably higher for the aligned transverse tripoles as compared to the staggered transverse tripoles. The aligned transverse tripoles facilitated deeper penetration into the medial dorsal columns (DCs). The staggered transverse tripoles always enabled broad and bilateral DC activation, at the expense of mediolateral steerability. The largest DC recruited area was obtained with the rostrally staggered transverse tripole. Transverse tripolar geometries, using percutaneous leads, allow for selective targeting of either medial or lateral DC fibers, if and only if the transverse tripole is aligned. Steering of anodal currents between the lateral leads of the staggered transverse tripoles cannot target medially confined populations of DC fibers in the spinal cord. An aligned transverse tripolar configuration is strongly recommended, because of its ability to provide more post-operative flexibility than other configurations.																		1741-2560	1741-2552		WOS:000287721700012	21248383	
J	Lee, Dongchul; Gillespie, Ewan; Bradley, Kerry								Dorsal Column Steerability with Dual Parallel Leads using Dedicated Power Sources: A Computational Model								JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS					48					e2443	10.3791/2443				FEB 2011	2011	In spinal cord stimulation (SCS), concordance of stimulation-induced paresthesia over painful body regions is a necessary condition for therapeutic efficacy. Since patient pain patterns can be unique, a common stimulation configuration is the placement of two leads in parallel in the dorsal epidural space. This construct provides flexibility in steering stimulation current mediolaterally over the dorsal column to achieve better pain-paresthesia overlap. Using a mathematical model with an accurate fiber diameter distribution, we studied the ability of dual parallel leads to steer stimulation between adjacent contacts on dual parallel leads using (1) a single source system, and (2) a multi-source system, with a dedicated current source for each contact. The volume conductor model of a low-thoracic spinal cord with epidurally-positioned dual parallel (2 mm separation) percutaneous leads was first created, and the electric field was calculated using ANSYS, a finite element modeling tool. The activating function for 10 um fibers was computed as the second difference of the extracellular potential along the nodes of Ranvier on the nerve fibers in the dorsal column. The volume of activation (VOA) and the central point of the VOA were computed using a predetermined threshold of the activating function. The model compared the field steering results with single source versus dedicated power source systems on dual 8-contact stimulation leads. The model predicted that the multi-source system can target more central points of stimulation on the dorsal column than a single source system (100 vs. 3) and the mean steering step for mediolateral steering is 0.02 mm for multi-source systems vs 1 mm for single source systems, a 50-fold improvement. The ability to center stimulation regions in the dorsal column with high resolution may allow for better optimization of paresthesia-pain overlap in patients.																		1940-087X			WOS:000209212900021	21339729

Effects on radiation oncology treatments involving various neuromodulation devices								JOURNAL OF X-RAY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				19	4			443	456		10.3233/XST-2011-0306				2011	2011	Object: Where no society-based or manufacturer guidance on radiation limits to neuromodulation devices is available, this research provides the groundwork for neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists who rely on the computerized treatment plan clinically for cancer patients. The focus of the article is to characterize radiation parameters of attenuation and scatter when an incident therapeutic x-ray beam is directed upon them. At the time of this writing, manufacturers of Neuromodulation products do not recommend direct exposure of the device in the beam nor provide guidance for the maximum dose for these devices.Methods: Ten neuromodulation models were chosen to represent the finite class of devices marketed by Medtronic before 2011. CT simulations permitted computer treatment modeling for dose distribution analysis as used routinely in radiation oncology for patients. Phantom case results were directly compared to actual clinical patient cases. Radiation detection measurements were then correlated to computational results. Where the x-ray beam passes through the device and is attenuated, dose reduction was identified with Varian Eclipse computer modeling for these posterior locations.Results: Although the computer algorithm did not identify physical processes of side-scatter and back-scatter, these phenomena were proven by radiation measurement to occur. In general, the computer results underestimated the level of change seen by measurement.Conclusions: For these implantable neurostimulators, the spread in dose changes were found to be -6.2% to -12.5% by attenuation, +1.7% to +3.8% by side-scatter, and +1.1% to +3.1% by back-scatter at 6 MV. At 18 MV, these findings were observed to be -1.4% to -7.0% by attenuation, +1.8% to 5.7% by side-scatter, and 0.8% to 2.7% by back-scatter. No pattern for the behavior of these phenomena was deduced to be a direct consequence of device size.																		0895-3996	1095-9114		WOS:000296146500003	25214379	
J	Vette, Albert H.; Yoshida, Takashi; Thrasher, T. Adam; Masani, Kei; Popovic, Milos R.								1A complete, non-lumped, and verifiable set of upper body segment parameters for three-dimensional dynamic modeling								MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS				33	1			70	79		10.1016/j.medengphy.2010.09.008				JAN 2011	2011	Dynamic models of the human trunk have been extensively used to investigate the biomechanics of lower back pain and postural instability in different populations. Despite their diverse applications, previous models rely on intrinsic upper body segment parameters (UBSP), e.g., each segment's mass-inertia characteristics. However, a comprehensive UBSP set allowing state-of-the-art, three-dimensional (3D) dynamic modeling does not exist to date. Therefore, our objective was to establish a UBSP set of all vertebral trunk segments that is accurate and complete. Based on high-resolution, transverse color images, anatomical structures of the Male Visible Human (MVH) were digitally reconstructed via commercial software. Subsequently, we identified the 3D spinal joint and 3D center of mass coordinates, the mass, and the moment of inertia tensor for 24 vertebral trunk segments and 4 upper limb segments (two segments per arm). Since the MVH images are public domain, the parameters are uniquely verifiable and expandable to also include lower limb parameters. To demonstrate the UBSP set's practicality, the parameters were finally implemented in a previously proposed inverse dynamics model of the upper body. Our findings reveal that an accurate and complete UBSP set has been obtained that will be beneficial to (1) systemize thinking in postural control studies; (2) quantify the effect of impact forces on the head and trunk (e.g., during whiplash); (3) suggest population-specific experiments based on theoretical insights into trunk dynamics (e.g., regarding lower back pain); or (4) assess the feasibility of new surgical techniques (e.g., spinal fusion) and neuroprostheses (e.g., after spinal cord injury).

Single and repeated stimulations were applied to the digital nerve of the left forelimb in ponies anaesthetised with isoflurane before, during and after intravenous administration of racemic ketamine. Surface electromyographic activity was recorded from the deltoid muscle. Higher stimulation intensity was required to evoke a reflex during ketamine administration. Furthermore, the amplitudes of response to stimulations were significantly and dose-dependently depressed and a flattening of the stimulus-response curves was observed. The reflex activity recovered partially once the ketamine infusion finished. The results demonstrated that the limb WR can be used to quantify the temporal effect of ketamine on the sensory-motor processing in ponies anaesthetised with isoflurane. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

NMDA Channels Together With L-Type Calcium Currents and Calcium-Activated Nonspecific Cationic Currents Are Sufficient to Generate Windup in WDR Neurons								JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				104	2			1155	1166		10.1152/jn.00834.2009				AUG 2010	2010	Aguiar P, Sousa M, Lima D. NMDA channels together with L-type calcium currents and calcium activated nonspecific cationic currents are sufficient to generate windup in WDR neurons. J Neurophysiol 104: 1155-1166, 2010. First published June 16, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00834.2009. Windup is characterized as a frequency-dependent increase in the number of evoked action potentials in dorsal horn neurons in response to electrical stimulation of afferent C-fibers. This phenomenon was first described in the mid-60s, but the core mechanisms behind it still remain elusive. Several factors affecting its dynamics have been identified, but the distinction between modulating mechanisms from generating mechanisms is not always clear. Several mechanisms contribute to the excitation of dorsal horn neurons exhibiting windup, and one of our main aims was to help making this distinction. The approach presented here relies on mathematical and computational analysis to study the mechanism(s) underlying windup. From experimentally obtained windup profiles, we extract the time scale of the facilitation mechanisms that may support the characteristics of windup. Guided by these values and using simulations of a biologically realistic compartmental model of a wide dynamic range (WDR) neuron, we are able to assess the contribution of each mechanism for the generation of action potentials windup. We show that the key mechanisms giving rise to windup is the temporal summation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) long-lasting postsynaptic responses taking place on top of a membrane potential cumulative depolarization. Calcium-activated nonspecific cationic currents driven by calcium influx from L-type calcium channels and synaptic currents support this cumulative depolarization and plateau formation in WDR neuron membrane potential. The effects of different nonhomogeneous stimulation protocols are explored, and their important role in clarifying many aspects of the windup generation is shown. The models are used to produce several predictions that can be tested experimentally.																		0022-3077			WOS:000280932400054	20554833	
J	Hjornevik, Trine; Schoultz, Bent W.; Marton, Janos; Gjerstad, Johannes; Drzezga, Alexander; Henriksen, Gjermund; Willoch, Frode								Spinal long-term potentiation is associated with reduced opioid neurotransmission in the rat brain								CLINICAL PHYSIOLOGY AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING				30	4			285	293		10.1111/j.1475-097X.2010.00939.x				JUL 2010	2010	P>Introduction:Neuronal events leading to development of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the nociceptive pathways may be a cellular mechanism underlying hyperalgesia. In the present study, we examine if induction of spinal LTP may be associated with functional changes in the supraspinal opioidergic system. The opioid receptors (ORs) play a key role in nociceptive processing and controlling the descending modulatory system to the spinal cord.Methods:Spinal LTP was induced by electrical high-frequency stimulation (HFS) conditioning applied to the sciatic nerve, and the excitability at spinal level was verified by spinal field potential recordings. To study supraspinal changes in opioid neurotransmission following the same HFS conditioning, we used small animal positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]Phenethyl-Orvinol ([11C]PEO). All rats included in the PET study were scanned at baseline and 150 min after HFS, and specific binding was calculated with a reference tissue model.Results:A clear C-fibre LTP, i.e. increased C-fibre response and reduced C-fibre threshold, was observed 150 min after HFS conditioning (t-test, P < 0 center dot 05, n = 6). Moreover, increased OR binding, relative to baseline, was observed after the same type of HFS conditioning ipsilaterally in the amygdala, hippocampus, somatosensory cortex and superior colliculus, and bilaterally in the nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen and hypothalamus (paired t-test, HFS > baseline, P < 0 center dot 05, n = 8).Conclusions:HFS conditioning of the sciatic nerve resulted in both spinal LTP and functional changes in supraspinal opioidergic signalling. Our findings suggest that induction of spinal LTP may be associated with reduced opioid neurotransmission in brain regions involved in pain modulation and affective-emotional responses.																		1475-0961			WOS:000278564500009	20662879	
J	Kuhn, Andreas; Keller, Thierry; Lawrence, Marc; Morari, Manfred								The Influence of Electrode Size on Selectivity and Comfort in Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation of the Forearm								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING				18	3			255	262		10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2039807				JUN 2010	2010	Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) is a technique to artificially activate motor nerves and muscles. It can be used for rehabilitation or the restoration of lost motor functions, e. g., in subjects with brain or spinal cord lesions. Apart from selectively activating motor nerves and muscles, TES activates sensory fibers and pain receptors, producing discomfort and pain. Clinicians try to minimize discomfort by optimizing stimulation parameters, electrode location, and electrode size. There are some studies that found optimal electrode sizes for certain stimulation sites (e. g., gastrocnemius), however the underlying effects why certain electrode sizes are preferred by patients is not well understood. We used a TES model consisting of a finite element (FE) model and a nerve model to assess the influence of different electrode sizes on the selectivity and the perceived comfort for various anatomies. Motor thresholds calculated using the TES model were compared with motor thresholds that were obtained from measurements performed on the forearm of ten human volunteers. Results of the TES model indicate that small electrodes (0.8 x 0.8 cm) are more comfortable for thin fat layers (0.25 cm) and superficial nerves (0.1 cm) and larger electrodes (4.1 x 4.1 cm(2)) are more comfortable for thicker fat layers (2 cm) and deeper nerves (1.1 cm) at a constant recruitment.																		1534-4320	1558-0210		WOS:000281782000005	20071267

Eksperimental'naia i klinicheskaia farmakologiia				73	5			41	4						2010-May	2010	In clinical practice, dimephosphon is used as a vasoactive agent in cases of traumatic brain injury. We have studied the influence of dimephosphon on the functional recovery of dog spinal cord after lesion. The spinal cord trauma was modeled using the methods described by Allen. In a period of time from the 1st to 10th day after injury, experimental group of animals was treated intravenously with 2.5% dimephosphon solution (18.75 mg/kg).The recovery of conduction in descending spinal nerves was studied using the transcranial magnetic stimulation technique on the Neurotest complex comprising a transcranial magnetic stimulator and a computer analyzer. The state of sacrolumbar motoneurons was determined by the method of stimulation electromyography that allows both H-reflex and M-wave responses to be recorded. The status of experimental animals, their locomotor activity and pain sensation were evaluated using standard clinical assessment. Morphological analysis performed with paraffin sections (hematoxylin-eosin staining) demonstrated that dimephosphon decreased the initiation of apoptosis and necrosis and supported the recovery of injured parts of spinal cord. Thus, the results revealed a beneficial effect of dimephosphon administration on the functional recovery of injured spinal cord.																		0869-2092			MEDLINE:20597371	20597371	
J	Summers, Paul E.; Ferraro, Diana; Duzzi, Davide; Lui, Fausta; Iannetti, Gian Domenico; Porro, Carlo A.								A quantitative comparison of BOLD fMRI responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli in the human spinal cord								NEUROIMAGE				50	4			1408	1415		10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.01.043				MAY 1 2010	2010	Recent studies have shown that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can non-invasively assess spinal cord activity. Yet, a quantitative description of nociceptive and non-nociceptive responses in the human spinal cord, compared with random signal fluctuations in resting state data, is still lacking. Here we have investigated the intensity and spatial extent of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses in the cervical spinal cord of healthy volunteers, elicited by stimulation of the hand dorsum (C6-C7 dermatomes). In a block design fMRI paradigm, periods (20 s each) of repetitive noxious (laser heat) or innocuous (brushing) stimulation were alternated with rest. To estimate the level of false positive responses, functional images were acquired during a separate run while subjects were at rest. In a first analysis of averaged peristimulus signals from all voxels within each half of the spinal cord, we found bilateral fMRI responses to both stimuli. These responses were significantly larger during noxious than during innocuous stimulation. No significant fMRI signal change was evident over corresponding time periods during the Rest run. In a second, general linear model analysis, we identified a voxel population preferentially responding to noxious stimulation, which extended rostro-caudally over the length (4 cm) of the explored spinal cord region. By contrast, we found no evidence of voxel populations responding uniquely to innocuous stimuli, or showing decreased activity following either kind of somatosensory stimulus. These results provide the first false-positive-controlled comparison of spinal BOLD fMRI responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli in humans, confirming and extending physiological information obtained in other species.

Tactile Sensory and Pain Networks in the Human Spinal Cord and Brain Stem Mapped by Means of Functional MR Imaging								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY				31	4			661	667		10.3174/ajnr.A1909				APR 2010	2010	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Touch and brush sensory stimuli elicit activity in discriminative touch pathways involving specific regions in the spinal cord and brain stem. However, no study has mapped normal sensory activity noninvasively in healthy humans. The purpose of this study is to map the neuronal activity of sensory input to understand abnormal sensory transmission.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, spinal fMRI (by using SEEP) was used to map the activity involved with light touch (2 g and 15 g von Frey filaments) and brush stimuli in the brain stem and spinal cords of 8 healthy volunteers. The results were spatially normalized and analyzed with custom-made software. Areas of SEEP activity were identified by using general linear model analysis.RESULTS: The 2 g von Frey filament showed predominant activity in the medulla around the ipsilateral dorsal gracile and cuneate nuclei. The 15 g filament elicited significant activity in the ipsilateral dorsal and contralateral ventral gray matter areas of the spinal cord, areas around the olivary nuclei, pontine reticular formation, periaqueductal gray, and raphe nuclei in the rostral pons and midbrain. The brush stimuli elicited more activity in the medulla around the ipsilateral cuneate and gracile nuclei.CONCLUSIONS: The 2 g filament and brush stimuli activated areas associated with a touch response. The 15 g filament activated areas associated with a pain response. The results from this study identify specific neuronal regions in the brain stem and spinal cord involved in sensory transmission and help understand altered sensory and pain states.																		0195-6108	1936-959X		WOS:000277000500016	20019102

TRPA1 modulation of spontaneous and mechanically evoked firing of spinal neurons in uninjured, osteoarthritic, and inflamed rats								MOLECULAR PAIN				6						14	10.1186/1744-8069-6-14				MAR 5 2010	2010	Background: There is growing evidence supporting a role for TRPA1 receptors in the neurotransmission of peripheral mechanical stimulation. In order to enhance understanding of TRPA1 contributions to mechanotransmission, we examined the effects a selective TRPA1 receptor antagonist, A-967079, on spinal neuronal activity following peripheral mechanical stimulation in uninjured, CFA-inflamed, and osteoarthritc (OA) rats.Results: Systemic injection of A-967079 (30 mu mol/kg, i.v.) decreased the responses of wide dynamic range (WDR), and nociceptive specific (NS) neurons following noxious pinch stimulation of the ipsilateral hind paw in uninjured and CFA-inflamed rats. Similarly, A-967079 reduced the responses of WDR neurons to high-intensity mechanical stimulation (300 g von Frey hair) of the knee joint in both OA and OA-sham rats. WDR neuronal responses to low-intensity mechanical stimulation (10 g von Frey hair) were also reduced by A-967079 administration to CFA-inflamed rats, but no effect was observed in uninjured rats. Additionally, the spontaneous activity of WDR neurons was decreased after A-967079 injection in CFA-inflamed rats but was unaltered in uninjured, OA, and OA-sham animals.Conclusions: Blockade of TRPA1 receptors disrupts transmission of high-intensity mechanical stimulation to the spinal cord in both uninjured and injured rats indicating that TRPA1 receptors have an important role in noxious mechanosensation in both normal and pathological conditions. TRPA1 receptors also contribute to the transmission of low-intensity mechanical stimulation, and to the modulation of spontaneous WDR firing, but only after an inflammatory injury.																			1744-8069		WOS:000275738400001	20205719	
J	Intondi, A. B.; Zadina, J. E.; Zhang, X.; Taylor, B. K.								TOPOGRAPHY AND TIME COURSE OF CHANGES IN SPINAL NEUROPEPTIDE Y IMMUNOREACTIVITY AFTER SPARED NERVE INJURY								NEUROSCIENCE				165	3			914	922		10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.10.052				FEB 3 2010	2010	We used a new computer-assisted method to precisely localize and efficiently quantify increases in neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity (NPY-ir) along the mediolateral axis of the L4 dorsal horn (DH) following transection of either the tibial and common peroneal nerves (thus sparing the sural branch, spared nerve injury (SNI)), the tibial nerve, or the common peroneal and sural nerves. Two weeks after SNI, NPY-ir increased within the tibial and peroneal innervation territories; however, NPY-ir in the central-lateral region (innervated by the spared sural nerve) was indistinguishable from that of sham. Conversely, transection of the sural and common peroneal nerves induced an increase in NPY-ir in the central-lateral region, while leaving the medial region (innervated by the tibial nerve) unaffected. All nerve injuries increased NPY-ir in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and nucleus gracilis (NG). By 24 weeks, both NPY-ir upregulation in the DH and hyper-responsivity to cold and noxious mechanical stimuli had resolved. Conversely, NPY-ir in DRG and NG, and hypersensitivity to non-noxious static mechanical stimuli, did not resolve within 24 weeks. Over this time course, the average cross-sectional area of NPY-immunoreactive DRG neurons increased by 151 mu m(2). We conclude that the upregulation of NPY after SNI is restricted to medial zones of the DH, and therefore cannot act directly upon synapses within the more lateral (sural) zones to control sural nerve hypersensitivity. Instead, we suggest that NPY in the medial DH tonically inhibits hypersensitivity by interrupting mechanisms of central sensitization and integration of sensory signals at the spinal and supraspinal levels.

All patients underwent SCS therapy for intractable pain, which was due to failed back surgery syndrome in three patients. complex regional pain syndrome in two, cerebral hemorrhage in two, spinal infarction in one, and spinal cord injury in one Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by (H2O)-O-15 PET before and after SCS. The images were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping software (SPM2) SCS reduced pain, visual analog scale values for pain decreased from 76.1 +/- 25.2 before SCS to 40 6 +/- 4 5 after SCS (mean +/- SE). Significant rCBF increases were identified after SCS in the thalamus contralateral to the painful limb and in the bilateral parietal association area. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and prefrontal areas were also activated after SCS These results suggest that SCS modulates supraspinal neuronal activities The contralateral thalamus and parietal association area would regulate the pain threshold. The ACC and prefrontal areas would control the emotional aspects of intractable pain. resulting Ill the reduction of neuropathic pain after SCS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

J	Silberstein, Morry								The cutaneous intrinsic visceral afferent nervous system: A new model for acupuncture analgesia								JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY				261	4			637	642		10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.09.008				DEC 21 2009	2009	The mechanism of acupuncture, whilst not known with certainty, has previously been considered to be stimulatory. A novel hypothesis is presented here in which C fiber tactile afferent axons bifurcate at acupuncture points and then diverge, running along acupuncture meridians, to subsequently communicate with Merkel cells. It is proposed that acupuncture disrupts the bifurcation of these axons, preventing neural transmission between Merkel cells as well as central communication with the spinal cord. Making use of the known phenomenon that acupuncture points have lower electrical resistance than adjacent skin, this hypothesis was tested using an electrical circuit model and successfully predicted the observed 10(3) reduction in skin resistance at acupuncture points. In addition to explaining acupuncture and the roles of both Merkel cells and C fiber tactile afferents, the model has greater implications for neuroscience, through the postulation of a new division of the autonomic nervous system.

A set of 7 standard contact configurations was used for each patient. Resistor network models mimicking these configurations were constructed. The University of Twente's Spinal Cord Stimulation software was used to simulate the effect of these contact configurations on large spinal nerve fibers. To allow a comparison of the measured and modeled energy per pulse, ail values were normalized.RESULTS: Both the empirical and the modeling results showed an increase in energy consumption with an increasing number of cathodes. Although the patient data with I and 2 cathodes did not differ significantly, energy consumption was significantly higher when 3 cathodes were used instead of I or 2 cathodes. The average energy consumption was significantly higher when bipolar stimulation was used instead of monopolar cathodal stimulation. An increasing number of anodes caused a decrease in energy consumption.CONCLUSION: When the paresthesia area can be covered with several configurations, it will be beneficial for the patient to program a configuration with I cathode and either no or multiple anodes.																		0148-396X			WOS:000272019600049	19934997

Five micrograms BmK 1 (691 nmol, in 10 mu L saline) administrated to the receptive fields induced spontaneous activity in 80% of RA and SAI fibers, increased the response to 10 g-10 s stimulation at about 20 times and altered the firing pattern to burst mode with maximal NS (number of spikes in burst) averaging from all fibers studied as many as 59. The increase in the excitability of RA and SAI fibers did not recover completely in 2 h.Our finding suggests that the gigantic abnormal activity in low threshold mechanical A fibers is involved in BmK scorpion sting pain, and the experimental model of BmK scorpion sting pain can be used to study A-fiber related central pathway which is important for relief of refractory neuropathic pain likewise.

Measurement of the magnitude of stimulation-induced activation, and its suppression with analgesics can provide objective measures of pain and efficacy of analgesics. This study investigates the feasibility of using spinal cord fMRI in anesthetized rats as a pain assay to test the analgesic effect of locally and systemically administered lidocaine. Blood volume (BV)-weighted fMRI signal acquired after intravenous injection of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles was used as an indirect readout of the neuronal activity. Transcutaneous noxious electrical stimulation was used as the pain model. BV-weighted fMRI signal could be robustly quantified on a run-by-run basis, opening the possibility of measuring pharmacodynamics (PD) of the analgesics with a temporal resolution of similar to 2 min. Local administration of lidocaine was shown to ablate all stimulation-induced fMRI signals by the total blockage of peripheral nerve transmission, while the analgesic effect of systemically administered lidocaine was robustly detected after intravenous infusion of similar to 3 mg/kg, which is similar to clinical dosage for human. This study establishes spinal cord fMRI as a viable assay for analgesics. With respect to the mode of action of lidocaine, this study suggests that systemic lidocaine, which is clinically used for the treatment of neuropathic pain, and believed to only block the peripheral nerve transmission of abnormal neural activity (ectopic discharge) originating from the damaged peripheral nerves, also blocks the peripheral nerve transmission of normal neural activity induced by transcutaneous noxious electrical stimulation.

We tested this hypothesis using a postoperative pain model, in conjunction with serial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).METHODS: We studied brain and subjective pain responses to innocuous and noxious heat in seven patients before and after total knee arthroplasty. Noxious and innocuous thermal stimuli were applied to the upper leg, proximal to the surgical area and to the lower forearm, a site remote from the surgical area. A group of eight age- and sex-matched control subjects underwent the same two-test procedure except that they were not submitted to an orthopedic surgical intervention.RESULTS: Subjective pain and brain responses to innocuous and noxious stimulation were not increased postoperatively. Actually, responses in primary and secondary somatosensory cortex for stimulation of the operated leg were significantly smaller after surgery. Brain responses in the control group did not differ significantly across the two sessions.CONCLUSION: These data argue against the development of an overall increased pain responsiveness after a major surgical trauma. The data are in contrast with results from animal studies and from brain imaging studies using surrogate models of clinical pain, which have shown increased central responsiveness in the area around the insult, thereby calling into question the clinical implications of acute postinjury sensitization.

In addition, the c-Fos expression was investigated in the supraspinal sites of the brain and in the spinal dorsal horn in association with the nociceptive processing in rats with neuropathic pain produced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) in the sciatic nerve. In the CCI-induced neuropathic rats, behavioral testing for determining the change in the withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation and immunohistochemical detection of c-Fos were both performed. The anti-allodynic effect derived from milnacipran gradually increased over the observation period, indicating that the delayed-onset analgesia might be elicited by the continuous administration of milnacipran. The increased level of c-Fos expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) induced by noxious mechanical stimulation was significantly inhibited by the continuous administration of milnacipran, indicating that milnacipran might cause a functional modification in the nociceptive processing in the ACC.

A preliminary investigation into the effect of coffee on hypolagesia associated with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation								CLINICAL PHYSIOLOGY AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING				29	4			293	299		10.1111/j.1475-097X.2009.00869.x				JUL 2009	2009	Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive, inexpensive analgesic technique used to relieve pain. It has been suggested that caffeine, an adenosine antagonist, may interfere with TENS action. This double-blind controlled pilot study investigated the effect of coffee on response to TENS in healthy human participants experiencing experimentally induced pain. Twelve participants (7 female, age range = 20-41 years) took part in two experiments separated by 24 h. Each experiment lasted 80 min and consisted of 3 x 15 min cycles: pre-TENS, during TENS predrink and during TENS postdrink [coffee (100 mg caffeine) or decaffeinated coffee randomized across experiments]. During each cycle, thresholds for electrical (EPT), mechanical (MPT) and cold pressor (CPT) pain were recorded. The statistical analysis modelled the responses for the coffee and decaffeinated coffee conditions during TENS (i.e. as a standard crossover) and detected no statistically significant effects between coffee and decaffeinated drinks for the natural logarithm (ln) transformed values of electrical pain threshold [ln EPT Coffee-ln EPT Decaffeinated coffee mean (standard error) = 0 center dot 0147 (0 center dot 2159)], mechanical pain threshold [ln MPT Coffee-ln MPT Decaffeinated coffee mean (standard error) = 0 center dot 1296 (0 center dot 0816)] and cold pain threshold [ln CPT Coffee-ln CPT Decaffeinated coffee mean (standard error) = 0 center dot 0793 (0 center dot 1139)]. We conclude that a single cup of coffee (100 mg caffeine) had no detectable effect on TENS outcome. Reasons why coffee did not produce a detectable effect on pain threshold are discussed.																		1475-0961	1475-097X		WOS:000266874200008	19486341

The neural mechanisms underlying this condition are not clear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the general effects of spinal deafferentiation and of bNP on electroencephalographic ( EEG) activity. In addition, the relationship between the presence of bNP and impaired function of the spinothalamic tract was studied. Measurements were performed in complete and incomplete spinal cord-injured subjects with and without bNP as well as in a healthy control group. Spinothalamic tract function, assessed by contact heat evoked potentials, did not differ between subjects with and without bNP; nevertheless, it was impaired in 94% of subjects suffering from bNP. In the EEG recordings, the degree of deafferentiation was reflected in a slowing of EEG peak frequency in the 6-12-Hz band. Taking into account this unspecific effect, spinal cord-injured subjects with bNP showed significantly slower EEG activity than subjects without bNP. A discrimination analysis in the subjects with spinothalamic tract dysfunction correctly classified 84% of subjects as belonging to either the group with bNP or the group without bNP, according to their EEG peak frequency. These findings could be helpful for both the development of an objective diagnosis of bNP and for testing the effectiveness of new therapeutic agents.																		0953-816X	1460-9568		WOS:000267538900010	19558605

Sites of plastic changes include the injured spinal cord itself as well as cortical and subcortical structures. Previously, cortical reorganization in response to sensory deprivation has mainly been studied using peripheral nerve injury models, and has led to a degree of understanding of mechanisms underlying reorganization and plastic changes. Deprivation or damage-induced CNS plasticity is not always beneficial for patients, and may underlie the development of conditions such as neuropathic pain and phantom sensations. Therefore, efforts not only to enhance, but also to control the capacity of plastic changes in the CAS, are of clinical relevance. Novel methods to stimulate plasticity as well its to monitor it, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging, respectively, may be useful in diverse clinical situations such as spinal cord injury and stroke. Here, human and animal studies of spinal cord injury are reviewed, with special emphasis on the contribution of the Nogo signaling system to cortical plasticity.																		1073-8584			WOS:000265938900014	19436077	
J	Lapirot, Olivier; Chebbi, Raja; Monconduit, Lenaic; Artola, Alain; Dallel, Radhouane; Luccarini, Philippe								NK1 receptor-expressing spinoparabrachial neurons trigger diffuse noxious inhibitory controls through lateral parabrachial activation in the male rat								PAIN				142	3			245	254		10.1016/j.pain.2009.01.015				APR 2009	2009	Diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) are very powerful long-lasting descending inhibitory controls, which are pivotal in modulating the activity of spinal and trigeminal nociceptive neurons. The principal feature of DNIC is that they are subserved by a loop that involves supraspinal structures that have not yet been identified. Using behavioral, in vivo extracellular electrophysiological and anatomical approaches, we Studied the neuronal network underlying DNIC. Using a new behavioral model of DNIC, in which facial grooming produced by formalin injection into the vibrissa pad is inhibited by a conditioning noxious stimulation, formalin injection into the hindpaw, we show that blockade of NK1 receptors in the lumbar spinal cord - by intrathecal administration of the NK1 receptor antagonist, RP67580 - largely attenuates DNIC-induced facial analgesia, In a second series of experiments, WDR neurons were recorded from the trigeminal subnucleus oralis and inhibited their C-fiber-evoked responses by the conditioning noxious heat stimulation of the hindpaw. We show that inactivating the lateral parabrachial area - by microinjecting the GABA(A) agonist, muscimol - strongly attenuates DNIC-induced inhibition of C-fiber-evoked responses. Finally. our neuroanatomical tracing Study demonstrates that the descending pathway for DNIC does not involve direct descending projections from the PB area. We conclude that (1) lamina I/III spinoparabrachial neurons that express the NK1 receptor and (2) parabrachial neurons are involved in the ascending part of the loop underlying DNIC and that the descending pathway for DNIC might include indirect projections to the spinal or medullary dorsal horn.

New method for quantification and statistical analysis of nociceptive reflex receptive fields in humans								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS				178	1			24	30		10.1016/j.jneumeth.2008.11.009				MAR 30 2009	2009	A method for quantifying nociceptive withdrawal reflex receptive fields in human volunteers and patients is described. The reflex receptive field (RRF) for a specific muscle denotes the cutaneous area from which a muscle contraction can be evoked by a nociceptive stimulus. The method is based on random stimulations presented in a blinded sequence to 10 stimulation sites. The sensitivity map is derived by interpolating the reflex responses evoked from the 10 sites. A set of features describing the size and location of the RRF is presented based on statistical analysis of the sensitivity map within every subject. The features include RRF area, volume, peak location and center of gravity. The method was applied to 30 healthy volunteers. Electrical stimuli were applied to the sole of the foot evoking reflexes in the ankle flexor tibialis anterior. The RRF area covered a fraction of 0.57 +/- 0.06 (S.E.M.) of the foot and was located on the medial, distal part of the sole of the foot. An intramuscular injection into flexor digitorum brevis of capsaicin was performed in one spinal cord injured subject to attempt modulation of the reflex receptive field. The RRF area, RRF volume and location of the peak reflex response appear to be the most sensitive measures for detecting modulation of spinal nociceptive processing. This new method has important potential applications for exploring aspects of central plasticity in volunteers and patients. It may be utilized as a new diagnostic tool for central hypersensitivity and quantification of therapeutic interventions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Results of this study showed significant reproducibility of SpSEP components between specimens (analysis of variance [ANOVA], p > 0.05) and recording days (ANOVA, p > 0.700) using this technique. SpSEP amplitudes were significantly reduced (similar to 50% of uninjured amplitude, ANOVA, p < 0.001) following SCI and remained depressed for 10 weeks post-injury. SpSEP amplitude following high-intensity stimuli (> 1mA) correlated with BBB locomotor score (Pearson, R > 0.353, P < 0.001). Characteristics of the mid- to long-latency SpSEPs suggest these components may reflect the integrity of the lateral pain pathway within the spinothalamic tract (STT). The technique and data presented in this study may be useful in future studies aimed at quantifying spinal cord integrity following injury and treatment using the rat model of SCI.																		0897-7151	1557-9042		WOS:000261718900004	18976168

Data were analysed using the random effects model, including adjustment to evaluate variability, size of study and bias in effect size. A total of 6535 participants were included in the meta-analysis; there were 8065 participants' outcomes measured due to multiple measurements per participant.Results: The H-Wave device decreased pain ratings across various chronic soft tissue inflammation and neuropathic pain conditions. The mean weighted effect size was 0.59, and the estimated effect size variance was 0.00003 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.580, 0.600). The H-Wave device also decreased the intake of pain medication in patients with various chronic soft tissue inflammation and neuropathic pain conditions. The mean weighted effect size was 0.56, and the estimated effect size variance was 0.000013 (95% CI: 0.553, 0.567). Patient functionality was also improved with use of the H-Wave device. The mean weighted effect size was 0.70, and the estimated effect size variance was 0.00002 (95% CI: 0.691, 0.709). A chi-square test for homogeneous effect sizes found highly significant (P < 0.00001) variability, indicating a robust significant effect size for increased functionality relative to both pain relief and reduction in pain medication. There was little to no evidence of any adverse effects associated with the use of the H-Wave device.Conclusion: The findings indicate a moderate to strong effect of the H-Wave device in providing pain relief, reducing the requirement for pain medication and increasing functionality. The most robust effect was observed for improved functionality, suggesting that the H-Wave device may facilitate a quicker return to work and other related daily activities.																		0741-238X	1865-8652		WOS:000258652800002	18636234

Discussion of the clinical goals of SCS as a treatment for neuropathic and ischemic pain includes accepted and emerging indications and focuses on various aspects of the technical goal of appropriate paresthesia coverage. While acknowledging that much remains to be discovered about the mechanisms of action of SCS, the review describes what is known about its neurochemical effects and summarizes the results of experimental and clinical studies that seek to illuminate why SCS is effective. After noting the importance and development of computer modeling studies that indicate ways to improve delivery of the electrical pulses, the review covers the advantages of various types of SCS electrodes and power generators and the use of computerized methods to optimize SCS therapy in individual patients and to provide information about the clinical performance of various types of equipment. Finally, this paper identifies important 'design issues And options as well as the challenges posed by various failure modes, by environmental and medical precautions, and by cost effectiveness and patient access issues.																		0018-9219	1558-2256		WOS:000257073900006

Reference lists and conference abstracts were examined for further relevant articles. We included studies that evaluated the effects of invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation of motor cortex on chronic pain using the visual analogue scale. Eleven studies using noninvasive brain stimulation and 22 studies using invasive brain stimulation met our inclusion criteria. The results showed that weighted responder rate was 72.6% (95% CI, 67.7-77.4) for the invasive stimulation studies and 45.3% (95% CI, 39.2-51.4) for the noninvasive stimulation studies. This difference was significant. For the noninvasive stimulation studies, the random effects model revealed that the number of responders in the active group was significantly higher as compared with sham stimulation group (risk ratio of 2.64) (95% CI, 1.63-4.30).Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows that two different techniques of brain stimulation of motor cortex-invasive and noninvasive-can exert a significant effect on pain in patients with chronic pain. We discuss potential reasons that invasive brain stimulation showed a larger effect in this meta-analysis. Our findings encourage continuation of research in this area and highlight the need for well-designed clinical trials to define the role of brain stimulation in pain management.																		0028-3878	1526-632X		WOS:000257060000011	18541887

The noxious-induced withdrawal reflex (NTWR) model is specifically designed and validated to quantitatively study the reaction on painful, multimodal stimuli in animals under anesthetic conditions. Since the anesthetic mechanisms differ between inhaled anesthetics and opioids, we evaluated the differential effects of isoflurane and fentanyl on c-fos expression at the lumbar level as a measure of nociceptive information transfer during general anesthesia.METHODS: The experimental setup consisted of a randomized block design with four experimental groups: two light 3/4 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) isoflurane anesthesia groups (unstimulated/NIWR-stimulated) and two NIWR-simulated surgical anesthesia groups (11/2 MAC isoflurane anesthesia and 3/4 MAC isoflurane anesthesia combined with fentanyl 400-600 mu g (.) kg(-1) (.) h(-1)). After 2 h of intermittent electrical stimulation of the hind paw of the rat, the number of Fos immunoreactive (Fos-IR) neurons in the dorsal horn was measured quantitatively.RESULTS: The main suppressive effects on lumbar c-fos expression of isoflurane were observed in the superficial lamina II (P = 0.02), whereas fentanyl showed the strongest effects in lamina V (P = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the NIWR model combined with spinal Fos-immunoreactivity is a suitable and useful model for evaluating the differential effects of inhaled anesthetics and opioids on nociceptive information transfer during general anesthesia.																		0003-2999			WOS:000254260200042	18349210	
J	Hornberger, John; Kurnar, Krishna; Verhulst, Eric; Clark, Mary Ann; Hernandez, John								Rechargeable spinal cord stimulation versus nonrechargeable system for patients with failed back surgery syndrome: A cost-consequences analysis								CLINICAL JOURNAL OF PAIN				24	3			244	252		10.1097/AJP.0b013e318160216a				MAR-APR 2008	2008	Objectives: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used for almost 40 years to treat refractory neuropathic pain after failed back surgery. Fully implantable nonrechargeable pulse generators have a battery life of between 2 and 5 years. A new SCS system with a rechargeable power source may last 10 to 25 years, or longer. The potential economic implications of longer battery life with a new SCS system has yet to be assessed. The study objective is to estimate the average difference in lifetime costs between rechargeable and nonrechargeable pulse generators used in treatment with SCS for failed back surgery syndrome.Methods: A generalized state-transition probability framework was used to model costs. Input parameters for the base case analysis were obtained from several data sources including published literature, Medicare fee schedules, Medicare claims data, and expert opinion.Results: A rechargeable SCS system is projected to require from 2.6 to 4.2 fewer battery generator replacements for battery depletion than a nonrechargeable SCS system. The total lifetime savings of a rechargeable system range from $104,000 to $168,833. In all of the one-way sensitivity analyses conducted, a rechargeable system saves money. Among all of the assumptions underlying the analysis, the annual cost after device removal contributes the most uncertainty.Conclusions: A rechargeable SCS system is projected to save up to $100,000 over a patient's lifetime. Fewer pulse generator replacements will also decrease patient discomfort and morbidity from procedural complications.																		0749-8047	1536-5409		WOS:000253708800010	18287831	
J	Farajidavar, Aydin; Saeb, Sohrab; Behbehani, Khosrow								Incorporating synaptic time-dependent plasticity and dynamic synapse into a computational model of wind-up								NEURAL NETWORKS				21	2-3			241	249		10.1016/j.neunet.2007.12.021				MAR-APR 2008	2008	"Wind-up", a condition related to chronic pain, is a form of plasticity in spinal dorsal horn that, can be observed during electrical stimulation of pain receptors at low frequencies (0.3-3 Hz). In this paper, we present a computational model to explain several aspects of wind-up. The core of this model is the interplay of spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP), short-term synaptic plasticity (STP), and different propagation velocities of the three afferent fibers (C, A delta, and A beta). We utilize lzhikevich's simple spiking neuron to model a dorsal horn neuron (DHN) of the spinal cord. To achieve the expected results, the model parameters need to adapt to the frequency response which is motivated by biological results. The adaptation is performed by a genetic algorithm (GA), and the resulting optimized values interestingly lie in biological ranges. Based on the proposed model, we suggest that STP may be the origin of the band-pass behavior of wind-Up between 0.3 and 3 Hz; while the STDP-based long-term plasticity can be responsible for the synaptic potentiation leading to wind-up, or similar phenomena such as central sensitization. Understanding the mechanisms underlying wind-up generation might allow clarification of the Molecular mechanisms of pain signaling and development of strategies, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), for pain treatment.

However, reported human data based on gradient-echo techniques have been largely inconsistent, with no clear patterns of activation emerging. One reason for this variability is the influence of physiological noise, which is typically not corrected for. By acquiring single-slice resting data from the spinal cord with a conventional gradient-echo EPI pulse sequence at TR=200 ms (critically sampled) and TR=3 s (under-sampled), we have chatacterised various sources of physiological noise. In 8 healthy subjects, the presence of physiologically dependent signal was explored using probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA). Based on the insights provided by PICA, we defined a new physiological noise model (PNM) based on retrospective image correction (RETROICOR), which uses independent physiological measurements taken from the subject to model sources of noise. Statistical significance of individual components included in the PNM was assessed by F-tests, which demonstrated that the optimal PNM included cardiac, respiratory, interaction and low-frequency regressors. In a group of 10 healthy subjects, activation data were acquired from the cervical spinal region (T1 to C5) during painful thermal stimulation of the right and left hands. The improvement obtained when using a PNM in estimating spinal cord activation was reflected in a reduction of false-positive activation (active voxels in the CSF space surrounding the cord), when compared to conventional GLM modelling without a PNM.

In this update, the indications for spinal cord stimulation are reviewed with attention to recent publications. A focused review of the literature on abdominal and visceral pain syndromes is also provided. Furthermore, the technology has evolved from the use of monopolar electrodes to complex electrode arrays. Similarly, the power source has changed from a radio frequency-driven system to a rechargeable impulse generator. These topics are covered, along with a short discussion of implant technique. Finally, we include a review of complications of such therapy. SCS as a technology and therapy continues to evolve.																		1933-7213	1878-7479		WOS:000252532300010	18164487

Curative-like analgesia in a neuropathic pain model: Parametric analysis of the dose and the duration of treatment with a high-efficacy 5-HT1A receptor agonist								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY				568	1-3			134	141		10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.04.022				JUL 30 2007	2007	High-efficacy activation of central 5-HT1A receptors by means of the recently discovered, selective 5-HT1A receptor ligand, F 13640 L(3-chloro-4-fluoro-phenyl)-[4-fluoro-4-1[(5-methyl-pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-amino]methyl piperidin-1-yl]methanone, fumaric acid salt] causes an unprecedented, broad-spectrum analgesia in rat models of acute and chronic pain of nociceptive and neuropathic origin; it also is effective in conditions where opioids either are ineffective, induce analgesic tolerance, or elicit persistent hyperalgesia/allodynia. Inversely mirroring morphine's actions, F 13640's ("curative-like") analgesic effects persist after the discontinuation of treatment. Here, we examined the relationships, if any, between the dose and the duration of F 13640 treatment on the one hand, and the duration of persistent analgesia on the other. Rats received unilateral intraorbital nerve injury and developed allodynia - as assessed by an increased response to von Frey filament stimulation within 24 days-, thereafter, using osmotic pumps, rats were subcutaneously infused with F 13640 in two experiments. In one, a one-week infusion was instituted at 0.04-10-mg/day doses; in a second experiment, a 0.63-mg/day dose was implemented for a duration ranging from I to 56 days. These 250- and 56-fold variations of the dose and duration of treatment caused post-treatment, persistent analgesia for about 10 and 40 days, respectively. At least as much as dose, the duration of F 13640 treatment determines F 13640-induced persistent analgesia. Neuroadaptive modulations at pre- and postsynaptic, brain and spinal cord 5-HT1A receptors may be involved in the dynamical, dose- and time-dependent, pretreatment rise and post-treatment decay of the analgesia induced by high-efficacy 5-HT1A receptor activation.

When using spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for chronic pain management, precise longitudinal positioning of the cathode is crucial to generate an electrical field capable of targeting the neural elements involved in pain relief. Presently used methods have a poor spatial resolution and lack postoperative flexibility needed for fine tuning and reprogramming the stimulation field after lead displacement or changes in pain pattern. We describe in this article a new method, "electrical field steering," to control paresthesia in SCS. The method takes advantage of newer stimulator design and a programming technique allowing for " continuous" adjustment of contact combination while controlling stimulation current for each contact separately. Method. Using computer modeling we examined how stimulation of dorsal column ( DC) and dorsal root (DR) fibers was influenced by changing the current ratio of the cathodes of a dual (- -) and a guarded dual cathode (+ - - +) configuration programmed on a percutaneous lead with 9 and 4 mm center-to-center contact spacing. Results. A cathodal current ratio could be found for which DC or DR fiber recruitment and thus, most likely, paresthesia coverage was maximized. The DR threshold profiles shifted longitudinally, thus following the shift in the electrical field during steering. The profiles had a constant shape when the contact spacing was small and a varying shape for wider contact separation. Generally, the wider contact separation provided less DC and more DR fiber recruitment. Conclusions. By means of cathodal steering on a longitudinal contact array, the group of excited DC and DR fibers, and thus paresthesia coverage, can be controlled when using SCS. With widely spaced contacts, superposition of the electrical field from each steering contact is limited. To precisely control segmental paresthesia ( DR stimulation), a small contact spacing is necessary.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000245256500004	22151861	
J	Holsheimer, J; Nguyen, J-P; Lefaucheur, J-P; Manola, L								Cathodal, anodal or bifocal stimulation of the motor cortex in the management of chronic pain?								Acta neurochirurgica. Supplement				97	Pt 2			57	66						2007	2007	The conditions of motor cortex stimulation (MCS) applied with epidural electrodes, in particular monopolar (cathodal or anodal) and bipolar stimulation, are discussed. The results of theoretical studies, animal experiments and clinical studies lead to similar conclusions. Basically, cortical nerve fibres pointing at the epidural electrode and those normal to this direction are activated by anodal and cathodal stimulation, respectively. Because MCS for the relief of chronic pain is generally applied bipolarly with electrodes at a distance of at least 10 mm, stimulation may actually be bifocal. The polarity and magnitude of a stimulus needed to recruit cortical nerve fibres varies with the calibre and shape of the fibres, their distance from the electrode and their position in the folded cortex (gyri and sulci). A detailed analysis of intra-operative stimulation data suggests that in bipolar MCS the anode of the bipole giving the largest motor response in the pain region is generally the best electrode for pain management as well, when connected as a cathode. These electrode positions are most likely confined to area 4.																		0065-1419			MEDLINE:17691290	17691290	
J	Manola, L; Holsheimer, J								Motor cortex stimulation: role of computer modeling.								Acta neurochirurgica. Supplement				97	Pt 2			497	503						2007	2007	Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is a promising clinical technique used to treat chronic, otherwise intractable pain. However, the mechanisms by which the neural elements that are stimulated during MCS induce pain relief are not understood. Neither is it known which of the main neural elements, i.e. cell bodies, dendrites or fibers are immediately excited by the electrical pulses in MCS. Moreover, it is not known what are the effects of MCS on fibers which are parallel or perpendicular to the cortical layers, below or away from the electrode. The therapy and its efficacy are less likely to be improved until it is better understood how it may work. In this chapter, we present our efforts to resolve this issue. Our computer model of MCS is introduced and some of its predictions are discussed. In particular, the influence of stimulus polarity and electrode position on the electrical field and excitation thresholds of different neural elements is addressed. Such predictions, supported with clinical evidence, should help to elucidate the immediate effects of an electrical stimulus applied over the motor cortex and may ultimately lead to optimizations of the therapy.																		0065-1419			MEDLINE:17691340	17691340

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective procedure for the treatment of neuropathic extremity pain, with success rates approaching 70%. However, mechanical failures, including breakage and migration, can significantly limit the long-term effectiveness of SCS. A systematic analysis of surgical techniques was undertaken by a consensus group, coupled with extensive in vivo and in vitro biomechanical testing of system components.Methods. A computer model based on morphometric data was used to predict movement in a standard SCS system between an anchored lead and pulse generator placed in various locations. These displacements were then used to determine a realistic range of forces exerted on components of the SCS system. Laboratory fixtures were constructed to subject leads and anchors to repetitive stresses until failure occurred. An in vivo sheep model also was used to determine system compliances and failure thresholds in a biologically realistic setting. A panel of experienced implanters then interpreted the results and related them to clinical observations.Results. Use of a soft silastic anchor pushed through the fascia to provide a larger bend radius for the lead was associated with a time to failure 65 times longer than an anchored but unsupported lead. In addition, failures of surgical paddle leads occurred when used with an anchor, whereas without an anchor, no failures occurred to 1 million cycles. Based on these findings, the panel recommended a paramedian approach, abdominal pulse generator placement, maximizing bend radius by pushing the anchor through the fascia, and anchoring of the extension connector near the lead anchor.Dsicussion. Several factors are important in longevity of SCS systems. We discovered that technical factors can make a large difference in SCS reliability and that strict attention to these "best practices" will provide the best chance for maintaining the integrity of SCS systems over the long term.																		1094-7159			WOS:000238487500002	22151706

Pharmacological fMRI has an additional contribution to make in the translation of disease models and candidate compounds from preclinical to clinical investigation and in the early stages of drug development. Here it can demonstrate a proof-of-concept of drug action in a small human cohort and thus contribute substantially to decision-making in drug development. We review the methods underlying pharmacological fMRI studies and the links that can be made between animal and human investigation. We discuss the potential fMRI markers of drug effect, experimental designs and caveats in interpreting hemodynamic fMRI data as reflective of changes in neuronal activity. Although there are no current published examples of fMRI applied to novel compounds, we illustrate the potential of fMRI across a range of applications with specific reference to processing of pain in the human brain and pharmacological analgesia. Pharmacological fMRI is developing to meet the neuroscientific challenges. Electrophysiological methods can be used to corroborate the drug effects measured hemodynamically with fMRI. In future, pharmacological fMRI is likely to extend to examinations of the spinal cord and into pharmacogenetics to relate genetic polymorphisms to differential responses of the brain to drugs.																		1053-1807	1522-2586		WOS:000238070400009	16649197

Then, effects of isoflurane administered at 0.85, 0.95, and 1.05 iMAC on the NWR were assessed. At each concentration, the NWR threshold was defined electromyographically for the common digital extensor and deltoid muscles by stimulating the digital nerve; additional electrical stimulations (3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mA) were delivered, and the evoked activity was recorded and analyzed. After the end of anesthesia, the NWR threshold was assessed in standing ponies.Results-Mean SD MAC of isoflurane was 1.0 +/- 0.20/6. The NWR thresholds for both muscles increased significantly in a concentration-dependent manner during anesthesia, whereas they decreased in awake ponies. Significantly higher thresholds were found for the deltoid muscle, compared with thresholds for the common digital extensor muscle, in anesthetized ponies. At each iMAC tested, amplitudes of the reflex responses from both muscles increased as stimulus intensities increased from 3 to 40 mA. A concentration-dependent depression of evoked reflexes with reduction in slopes of the stimulus-response functions was detected.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Anesthetic-induced changes in sensory-motor processing in ponies anesthetized with isoflurane at concentrations of approximately 1.0 MAC can be detected by assessment of NWR. This method will permit comparison of effects of inhaled anesthetics or anesthetic combinations on spinal processing in equids.																		0002-9645			WOS:000237170800005	16649907	
J	Baars, JH; Tas, S; Herold, KF; Hadzidiakos, DA; Rehberg, B								The suppression of spinal F-waves by propofol does not predict immobility to painful stimuli in humans								BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA				96	1			118	126		10.1093/bja/aei283				JAN 2006	2006	Background. The immobilizing effects of volatile anaesthetics are primarily mediated at the spinal level. A suppression of recurrent spinal responses (F-waves), which reflect spinal excitability, has been shown for propofol. We have assessed the concentration-dependent F-wave suppression by propofol and related it to the logistic regression curve for suppression of movement to noxious stimuli and the effect on the bispectral index (TM) (BIS (TM)). The predictive power of drug effects on F-waves and BIS for movement responses to noxious stimuli was tested.Methods. In 24 patients anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol infused by a target controlled infusion pump at stepwise increasing and decreasing plasma concentrations between 0.5 and 4.5 mg litre(-1). The F-waves of the abductor hallucis muscle were recorded at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. BIS values were recorded continuously. Calculated propofol concentrations and F-wave amplitude and persistence were analyzed in terms of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model with a simple sigmoid concentration-response function. Motor responses to tetanic electrical stimulation (50 Hz, 60 mA, 5 s, volar forearm) were tested and the EC50tetanus was calculated using logistic regression.Results. For slowly increasing propofol concentrations, computer fits of the PK/PD model for the suppression by propofol yielded a median EC50 of 1.26 (0.4-2.3) and 1.9 (1.0-2.8) mg litre(-1) for the F-wave amplitude and persistence, respectively. These values are far lower than the calculated EC50 for noxious electrical stimulation of 3.75 mg litre(-1). This difference results in a poor prediction probability of movement to noxious stimuli of 0.59 for the F-wave amplitude.Conclusions. F-waves are almost completely suppressed at subclinical propofol concentrations and they are therefore not suitable for prediction of motor responses to noxious stimuli under propofol mono-anaesthesia.																		0007-0912			WOS:000234433300020	16317030

Annual Conference				2006				4975	8						2006	2006	Wind-up, a condition related to chronic pain, is described traditionally as a frequency dependent increase in the excitability of sensory spinal cord neurons, evoked by electrical stimulation of small pain fibers. In this paper, we introduce a computational model on wind-up of large (Abeta) fibers, considering three major mechanisms of wind-up: 1) a feedforward mechanism causing Ca2+ entry, 2) a positive feedback, causing more Ca2+ entry, and 3) a feedforward due to sprouting of Abeta fibers towards the small pain fibers. Our model proposes three different ways for reducing wind-up and shows the most important way to treat the pain.																		1557-170X			MEDLINE:17946665	17946665	
J	Hoseini, SS; Hoseini, M; Gharibzadeh, S								Sprouting phenomenon, a new model for the role of A-beta fibers in wind up								MEDICAL HYPOTHESES				66	4			805	807		10.1016/j.mehy.2005.09.047				2006	2006	Wind up is a progressive frequency-dependent facilitation of the responses of nociceptive neurons observed on the application of repetitive (usually electrical) stimuli of constant intensity. The NMDA and NK1 receptors are essentially involved in wind up. After induction of wind up, stimulation of C-fibers show the characteristics of wind up, but stimulation of A beta fibers for induction of wind up is controversial. In this study, we have proposed a new model for the role of A beta fibers in wind up, through sprouting of nerve fibers in the dorsal horn of spinal cord. We named it "sprouting phenomenon". It has been reported that in some clinical hyperalgesic states induced by peripheral injury or inflammation, wind up may aggravate the pain. For example, studies have indicated the presence of wind up in post-surgical states, some neuropathic pains, fibromyalgia syndrome, and post-herpetic neuralgia. According to sprouting phenomenon, it seems that some clinical interventions can be assessed to alleviate post-inflammatory pains: (1) Immediate and complete relief of inflammation by anti-inflammatory agents to prevent repetitive excitation of C-fibers and subsequent morphological changes of dorsal horn laminae; (2) using local anesthetics in order to prevent pain signal transmission; (3) prevention of sprouting by intrathecal injection of some anti-proliferation agents; (4) using NMDA or NK1 receptor antagonists to prevent central mechanism of wind up. Some clinical trials have indicated the effectiveness of these antagonists. It is worth noting that future clinical studies are needed to validate these predictions.

The effect of this phenomenon on cervical spinal kinematics has not been quantitatively determined.Methods. A comprehensively validated computational model exercised in 2.7 m/s rear impact was used to determine effects of superior translation and extension rotation of T1 on cervical segmental kinematics during the retraction phase.Findings. In general, thoracic ramping had a minimal effect on cervical intervertebral kinematics during retraction.Interpretation. Results of the present study demonstrated that magnitude of thoracic ramping plays a minimal role in the whiplash injury mechanism due to decreased effect on cervical segmental kinematics.

Mice overexpressing galanin had a moderate heat hypoalgesia, reduced spinal sensitization after repetitive C-fiber stimulation and reduced development of neuropathic pain-like behavior after sciatic nerve injury. On the other hand, mice lacking the GALR1 receptor (Galr1(-/-)) exhibited only slight increase in heat nociception in the hot plate, but not tail flick, test and showed no increase in spinal sensitization. The duration, but not magnitude, of neuropathic pain-like behaviors, was increased in Galr1(-/-) mice after nerve injury. These results support an inhibitory effect of galanin on nociception, but the physiological role played by galanin via GALR1 receptors needs to be further studied. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in humans evokes head pain. Second-order neurons in the trigeminal nucleus that are activated by SSS stimulation can be inhibited by PAG stimulation. The present study was undertaken to identify pontine and medullary structures that respond to noxious stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus or to ventrolateral PAG stimulation. The distribution of neurons expressing the protein product (fos) of the c-fos immediate early gene were examined in the rostral medulla and caudal pons of the cat after (i) sham, (ii) stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus, (iii) stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus with PAG stimulation, or (iv) stimulation of the PAG alone. The structures examined for fos were the trigeminal nucleus, infratrigeminal nucleus, reticular nuclei, nucleus raphe magnus, pontine blink premotor area, and superior salivatory nucleus. Compared with all other interventions, fos expression was significantly greater in the trigeminal nucleus and superior salivatory nucleus after SSS stimulation. After PAG with SSS stimulation, on the side ipsilateral to the site of PAG stimulation, fos was significantly greater in the nucleus raphe magnus. These structures are likely to be involved in the neurobiology of migraine. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																		0006-8993	1872-6240		WOS:000229530300001	15910757

Replicating earlier data, F 13640 (0.63 mg/kg, i.p.; t(-15 min)) completely inhibited the elevation and licking of the formalin-injected paw. In the same animals, and in spite of the agent as in earlier data increasing the number of c-Fos labelled nuclei when it was administered alone, F 13640 markedly reduced the number of formal in-induced c-Fos labelled nuclei. This was found in both the superficial (I-II) and deep (V-VI) dorsal horn laminae (2 h post-injection: 72 +/- 2% and 92 +/- 1% of reduction, respectively; P < 0.001 in either case), spinal areas that contain neurons responsive to nociceptive stimulation. Co-operation occurred so that after the co-administration of F 13640 and formalin, c-Fos expression was inferior to that induced when either stimulation was administered alone. The data provide initial evidence for the agent's inhibitory effects on noxiously evoked c-Fos expression. The results indicate that co-operation between 5-HT1A receptor activation and nociceptive stimulation powerfully inhibits responses to severe, tonic nociception. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the effects of preoperative administration of intrathecal COX inhibitors in this model. Fifteen minutes before surgery, rats received intrathecally the COX-1 preferring inhibitor, ketorolac, the specific COX-1 inhibitor, SC-560, the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398, or vehicle. A 1-cm longitudinal incision was en made through skin, fascia, and muscles of the plantar aspect of a left paw in male rats. Withdrawal threshold to von Frey filaments was measured at 2 h, 4 h, and at intervals up to 5 days later. Ketorolac and SC-560 increased withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation, but NS-398 had no significant effect. These results suggest that COX-1 plays an important role in spinal cord pain processing and sensitization after surgery and that preoperative intrathecal administration of specific COX-1 inhibitors may be useful to treat Postoperative pain.																		0003-2999			WOS:000228755400035	15845692

Posteroanterior mobilisation is a manual therapy technique that is commonly used in the examination and treatment of neck pain, but little is known about its biomechanical effect. The purpose of this study was to determine the intervertebral movements of the cervical spine produced by posteroanterior mobilisation.Methods. The cervical spines of nineteen healthy subjects were scanned using an open interventional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Posteroanterior mobilisation forces were applied to the fifth cervical vertebra whilst they were in the prone position. Sagittal images of the spine were obtained before and during mobilisation,Findings. It was shown that posteroanterior mobilisation of the cervical spine generally produced extension of the upper motion segments and flexion of the lower segments. The middle segments were inconsistent in the direction of rotation. The cervical lordosis was found to increase with repeated PA loading cycles.Interpretation. The magnitude of intervertebral movement produced by mobilisation is small. Forces applied at one spinous process produced not only movements at the target vertebra but also movements of the entire cervical spine resulting in an increase in lordosis. Mobilisation should be interpreted as three-point bending of the entire cervical spine, rather than simple gliding of one vertebra upon another. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Heinricher, MM; Neubert, MJ								Neural basis for the hyperalgesic action of cholecystokinin in the rostral ventromedial medulla								JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				92	4			1982	1989		10.1152/jn.00411.2004				OCT 2004	2004	The analgesic actions of opioids can be modified by endogenous "anti-opioid" peptides, among them cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK is now thought to have a broader, pronociceptive role, and contributes to hyperalgesia in inflammatory and neuropathic pain states. The aim of this study was to determine whether anti-opioid and pronociceptive actions of CCK have a common underlying mechanism. We showed previously that a low dose of CCK microinjected into the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) blocked the analgesic effect of systemically administered morphine by preventing activation of OFF-cells, which are the antinociceptive output of this well characterized pain-modulating region. At this antiopioid dose, CCK had no effect on the spontaneous activity of these neurons or on the activity of ON-cells ( hypothesized to facilitate nociception) or "NEUTRAL cells" ( which have no known role in pain modulation). In this study, we used microinjection of a higher dose of CCK into the RVM to test whether activation of ON-cells could explain the pronociceptive action of this peptide. Paw withdrawal latencies to noxious heat and the activity of a characterized RVM neuron were recorded in rats lightly anesthetized with methohexital. CCK ( 30 ng/200 nl) activated ON-cells selectively and produced behavioral hyperalgesia. Firing of OFF-cells and NEUTRAL cells was unaffected. These data show that direct, selective activation of RVM ON-cells by CCK is sufficient to produce thermal hyperalgesia and indicate that the anti-opioid and pronociceptive effects of this peptide are mediated by actions on different RVM cell classes.																		0022-3077			WOS:000223954500006	15152023	
J	Anderson, KD								Targeting recovery: Priorities of the spinal cord-injured population								JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA				21	10			1371	1383		10.1089/neu.2004.21.1371				OCT 2004	2004	In the United States alone, there are more than 200,000 individuals living with a chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Healthcare for these individuals creates a significant economic burden for the country, not to mention the physiological, psychological, and social suffering these people endure everyday. Regaining partial function can lead to greater independence, thereby improving quality of life. To ascertain what functions are most important to the SCI population, in regard to enhancing quality of life, a novel survey was performed in which subjects were asked to rank seven functions in order of importance to their quality of life. The survey was distributed via email, postal mail, the internet, interview, and word of mouth to the SCI community at large. A total of 681 responses were completed. Regaining arm and hand function was most important to quadriplegics, while regaining sexual function was the highest priority for paraplegics. Improving bladder and bowel function was of shared importance to both injury groups. A longitudinal analysis revealed only slight differences between individuals injured <3 years compared to those injured >3 years. The majority of participants indicated that exercise was important to functional recovery, yet more than half either did not have access to exercise or did not have access to a trained therapist to oversee that exercise. In order to improve the relevance of research in this area, the concerns of the SCI population must be better known and taken into account. This approach is consistent with and emphasized by the new NIH roadmap to discovery.																		0897-7151	1557-9042		WOS:000224817800002	15672628

Monopolar and tripolar (guarded cathode) stimulation with both lead types in a low-thoracic spine model was simulated using UT-SCS software. Dorsal column and dorsal root fiber thresholds were calculated as well as the area of recruited fibers in the dorsal columns, the rostrocaudal span of recruited dorsal root fibers and the energy consumption at discomfort threshold. Tripolar stimulation is superior to monopolar stimulation in the recruitment of the dorsal columns, a percutaneous lead recruits a similar to12% larger dorsal column area than a laminectomy lead does. This difference is reduced when the contact spacing of the lead models is the same. A percutaneous lead with significant wire impedance (140 Ohms) consumes similar to115-240% more energy, whereas the same lead with negligible wire impedance consumes similar to40-85% more energy. A deterioration of all performance parameters is predicted when a percutaneous lead is placed more dorsally in the epidural tissue. When positioned next to the dura mater, a percutaneous lead has a similar performance (fiber recruitment in the dorsal columns and the dorsal roots) as a laminectomy lead with similar contact spacing, but substantially higher energy consumption. The superior clinical performance of the laminectomy lead is most probably due to the difference in volume and insertion technique of the two lead types.																		1094-7159	1525-1403		WOS:000224523000001	22151331	
J	Hao, JX; Kupers, RC; Xu, XJ								Response characteristics of spinal cord dorsal horn neurons in chronic allodynic rats after spinal cord injury								JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				92	3			1391	1399		10.1152/jn.00121.2004				SEP 2004	2004	The physiological mechanisms of chronic pain in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) are poorly understood. In the present study, we explored response characteristics of dorsal horn neurons of spinally injured rats exhibiting chronic pain (pain-like response to innocuous mechanical and cold stimulation). Several abnormalities were found in the distribution and response characteristics of dorsal horn neurons in chronic allodynic rats. First, 17% of the recorded neurons (vs. 0% in control animals) had no receptive field. Most of these units were located at or close to the lesioned spinal segment, and they discharged spontaneously at high frequencies. Allodynic rats also showed a significant decrease in the proportion of low-threshold ( LT) neurons and an increase in the proportion of wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons. The rate of spontaneous activity of high-threshold (HT) neurons was significantly higher in allodynic compared with control rats. Moreover, HT neurons in allodynic animals showed increased neuronal responses to mechanical stimulation. WDR neurons responded with higher discharge rates to innocuous von Frey hair stimulation in allodynic compared with control rats. The percentage of WDR and HT neurons showing afterdischarges to noxious pinch was also significantly increased in the allodynic rats. The proportion of WDR and HT neurons responding to innocuous cold stimulation respectively increased from 53 and 25% in control rats to 91 and 75% in allodynic animals. These results suggest that the chronic pain-like behaviors in spinally injured rats may be generated and maintained by abnormalities in dorsal horn neurons.																		0022-3077	1522-1598		WOS:000223539400015	15331646

Rats implanted with lumbar intrathecal catheters were injected intrathecally with saline (control), bupivacaine (1 to 100 mug), or clonidine (0.1 to 3 mug) and tested for their responses to thermal stimulation to the tail (tail flick test) and subcutaneous formalin injection into the hindpaw (formalin test). The effects of the combination of bupivacaine and clonidine on both stimuli were tested by isobolographic analysis. General behavior and motor function were examined as side effects. The 50% effective doses of bupivacaine and clonidine were significantly smaller when combined compared with each single drug in both the tail flick test (2.82 and 0.11 mug versus 7.1 and 0.29 mug, respectively) and phase 1 (0.24 and 0.009 mug versus 5.7 and 0.15 mug) and phase 2 (0.31 and 0.012 mug versus 3.2 and 0.16 mug) of the formalin test. Side effects were decreased by the combination. These results suggest a favorable combination of intrathecal bupivacaine and clonidine in the management of acute and inflammatory pain.																		0003-2999			WOS:000220491700033	15041598

To explore the mechanism of radiotherapy-induced analgesia, we have developed an animal model of bone pain resulting from cancer invasion. Using this animal model system, radiation-induced pain response and pain-related signals in the spinal cord were analyzed. The hind paw model of bone pain from cancer invasion was developed by injecting transplantable hepatocellular carcinoma, HCa-1, into the periosteal membrane of the foot dorsum in C3H/Hej mice. Bony invasion from HCa-1 cells was confirmed by histopathological examinations. We also measured the development of pain-associated behaviors. In this model, changes in the objective level of pain response after irradiation of the tumor were analyzed. Expression of pain-related host signals in the spinal cord, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, and c-fos, was investigated with immunohistochemical staining. In the histopathological examinations, bone invasion from HCa-1 cells was seen from day 7 and was evident at day 14 after injection. Measurable pain-associated behaviors were developed from day 7. In this model, mice treated with radiotherapy showed decreased objective levels of pain with a higher threshold to graded mechanical stimulation than did control mice from day 3 after irradiation. After irradiation of tumors, significant decreases in the expression of CGRP were shown in the spinal cord, whereas neither substance P nor c-fos showed any alteration. We developed a novel hind paw model of bone pain from cancer invasion that was confirmed by histopathological examination and measurable pain-associated behaviors. Radiotherapy decreased the objective level of pain and the underlying mechanism involved in the alteration of pain-related host signal, CGRP, in the spinal cord.

J	Uchiyama, T; Johansson, H; Windhorst, U								A model of the feline medial gastrocnemius motoneuron-muscle system subjected to recurrent inhibition								BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS				89	2			139	151		10.1007/s00422-003-0413-y				AUG 2003	2003	Recurrent inhibition in the mammalian spinal cord is complex, and its functions are not yet well understood. Skeletomotoneurons (alpha-MNs) excite, via recurrent axon collaterals, inhibitory Renshaw cells (RCs), which in turn inhibit alpha-MNs and other neurons. The anatomical and functional structure of the recurrent inhibitory network is nonhomogeneous, and the gain and filtering characteristics of RCs are modulated by inputs circumventing alpha-MNs. This complex organization is likely to play important roles for the discharge and recruitment properties of alpha-MNs. Modeling this system is a way of investigating hypothesized roles for normal functioning including muscle fatigue and different forms of physiological pathological tremor. In this paper, a detailed model including alpha-MNs, RCs, and the muscle fibers innervated by the alpha-MNs is presented. Outlines of the experimental data underlying the model and the modeling philosophy and procedure are presented. Then the behavior of a RC model is compared with experimental data reported in the literature. Model and experimental data agree well for burst responses elicited by synchronous single-pulse activation of different numbers of motor axons. In addition, the static relation between motor-axon activation rate and RC firing rate agree fairly well in model and experiment, and the same applies to the dynamic responses to step changes in motor-axon rate. The ultimate objective is to use this model in probing the role of recurrent inhibition in the control and stability of (isometric) muscular force under normal and altered conditions occurring during fatigue and muscle pain.																		0340-1200	1432-0770		WOS:000185256200006	12905042	
J	Urch, CE; Dickenson, AH								In vivo single unit extracellular recordings from spinal cord neurones of rats								BRAIN RESEARCH PROTOCOLS				12	1			26	34		10.1016/S1385-299X(03)00068-0				AUG 2003	2003	A method for in vivo single unit extracellular recordings from the dorsal horn of rat or mouse spinal cords is described. This method allows the complex, dynamic and plastic circuitry of the dorsal horn to be explored in various models and situations. Briefly, the spinal cord is exposed in deeply anaesthetised animals and a recording electrode is inserted into the dorsal horn. To isolate a neurone the electrode is moved incrementally through the cord whilst the ipsilateral hindpaw (receptive field) is stimulated with a light tap. The neurone can then be characterised according to its depth, latency of Abeta-, Adelta- and C-fibre responses and its response to natural (brush, heat, pressure) and electrical stimulation. The neuronal response is captured, filtered, amplified and displayed via an oscilloscope and speakers, and fed through to a computer where the responses can be integrated and displayed in numerous formats. This basic technique can be adapted to record from animals of various ages, to investigate alterations in spinal processing, suprapsinal influences, receptive field size and so on, and to assess the impact of therapeutic or other interventions. A key issue is that this type of approach, unlike behavioural assessment that relies on threshold measures, allows quantitative measures of suprathreshold activity, closer to the clinical situation.

J	Amir, R; Devor, M								Extra spike formation in sensory neurons and the disruption of afferent spike patterning								BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL				84	4			2700	2708		10.1016/S0006-3495(03)75075-9				APR 2003	2003	The peculiar pseudounipolar geometry of primary sensory neurons can lead to ectopic generation of "extra spikes" in the region of the dorsal root ganglion potentially disrupting the fidelity of afferent signaling. We have used an explicit model of myelinated vertebrate sensory neurons to investigate the location and mechanism of extra spike formation, and its consequences for distortion of afferent impulse patterning. Extra spikes originate in the initial segment axon under conditions in which the soma spike becomes delayed and broadened. The broadened soma spike then re-excites membrane it has just passed over, initiating an extra spike which propagates outwards into the main conducting axon. Extra spike formation depends on cell geometry, electrical excitability, and the recent history of impulse activity. Extra spikes add to the impulse barrage traveling toward the spinal cord, but they also travel antidromically in the peripheral nerve colliding with and occluding normal orthodromic spikes. As a result there is no net increase in afferent spike number. However, extra spikes render firing more staccato by increasing the number of short and long interspike intervals in the train at the expense of intermediate intervals. There may also be more complex changes in the pattern of afferent spike trains, and hence in afferent signaling.																		0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000183123100056	12668478	
J	Vrinten, DH; Hamers, FFT								'CatWalk' automated quantitative gait analysis as a novel method to assess mechanical allodynia in the rat; a comparison with von Frey testing								PAIN				102	1-2			203	209		10.1016/S0304-3959(02)00382-2				MAR 2003	2003	A characteristic symptom of neuropathic pain is mechanical allodynia. In animal models of neuropathic pain, mechanical allodynia is often assessed using von Frey filaments. Although the forces applied with these filaments are highly reproducible, there are various disadvantages of using this method. Testing paradigms and definitions of withdrawal threshold are not standardised. Moreover, measurements may be influenced by various conditions, such as ambient temperature, humidity, weight bearing of the limb and stress. We have therefore investigated another technique to assess mechanical allodynia, the 'CatWalk' automated quantitative gait analysis. With this computer-assisted method of locomotor analysis, it is possible to objectively and rapidly quantify several gait parameters, including duration of different phases of the step cycle and pressure applied during locomotion. We tested rats with a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, a model of neuropathic pain, both with von Frey filaments and the CatWalk method. We demonstrate that these rats mininuse contact with the affected paw during locomotion, as demonstrated by a reduction in stance phase and pressure applied during stance. Moreover, these parameters show a high degree of correlation with mechanical withdrawal thresholds as determined by von Frey filaments. We therefore suggest that the CatWalk method might serve as an additional tool in the investigation of mechanical allodynia. (C) 2002 International Association for the Study of Pain.

For this purpose, at first, a model of the system was constructed from which the system transfer function was obtained. Then, the relationship between the transfer gain and each parameter was evaluated using mathematical equations and a specifically built computer program. This study showed that the gain could be increased selecting small values for some parameters (the number of active coil windings, first radii of inner and outer paths of the core, heights of the core base and windings, position under the skin, internal resistances of the active and passive coils, tissue impedance between the contacts of electrode), and high values for the others (the number of passive coil windings, second radii of inner and outer paths of the core, frequency of the signal, relative magnetic permeability of the core). Critical saturation values were another considerable point. The nearest commercially available standard values should be preferred in practical applications.

To present the current understanding of the mechanisms of spinal cord stimulation in relation to the physiology of pain.Summary of Background Data. Spinal cord stimulation has been used for more than 30 years in the armamentarium of the interventional pain specialist to treat a variety of pain syndromes. Traditionally used for persisting leg pain after lumbar spinal surgery, it has been applied successfully in the treatment of angina pectoris, ischemic pain in the extremity, complex regional pain syndrome Types 1 and 2, and a variety of other pain states. This review presents the current status of what is known concerning how electrical stimulation of the spinal cord may achieve pain relief.Methods. A literature review was conducted.Results. The literature supports the theory that the mechanism of spinal cord stimulation cannot be completely explained by one model. It is likely that multiple mechanisms operate sequentially or simultaneously.Conclusion. Some clinical or experimental support can be found in the literature for 10 specific mechanisms or proposed mechanisms of spinal cord stimulation.																		0362-2436	1528-1159		WOS:000179365500027	12435996	
J	Feirabend, HKP; Choufoer, H; Ploeger, S; Holsheimer, J; van Gool, JD								Morphometry of human superficial dorsal and dorsolateral column fibres: significance to spinal cord stimulation								BRAIN				125				1137	1149		10.1093/brain/awf111				MAY 2002	2002	In spinal cord stimulation (SCS) large diameter cutaneous (Abeta) fibres in the dorsal columns (DCs) are activated and have an inhibiting effect on the transmission of pain signals by Adelta and C fibres from the corresponding dermatome(s). The largest Abeta fibres can be activated up to a maximum depth of about 0.25 mm in the DCs. No data are available on the distribution of the large fibres in this superficial human DC layer at the common SCS levels Th10-11. Such data are indispensable to improve the predictive capability of a computer model of SCS. The whole myelinated fibre population in the superficial 300 mum of the dorsal column (DC0-300) at Th10-11 of two human subjects was morphometrically analysed. Some data was obtained from a third subject. The superficial dorsolateral column (DLC0-300) was included in this analysis because it was hypothesized that large dorsal spinocerebellar tract fibres could also be activated by SCS. Only very few fibres larger than 10.7 mum were found: a mean of 68 (0.5%) in DC0-300 and 114 (2%) in DLC0-300. Considering that the effect of SCS is primarily attributed to activation of these largest fibres, it is concluded that a surprisingly small average amount of 2.4 fibres per running 0.1 mm width and 6 fibres per segmental division of the DC is involved. Distinct mediolateral heterogeneity in fibre composition was found in both DC0-300 and DLC0-300. In the DC0-300, the mean diameter of fibres greater than or equal to7.1 mum increases significantly by 5% from medial to lateral. Density (i.e. number of fibres per 1000 mum(2)) and frequency (i.e. percentage of a fibre size group compared. to its parent population) of the large fibres increase significantly from medial to lateral in the DC0-300. For fibres greater than or equal to10.7 mum, these parameters increase by 200 and 269%, respectively. It is concluded that the difference in stimulation threshold of large Abeta fibres in the median and lateral DC can be mainly attributed to the absence and presence, respectively, of collaterals at the stimulation site. Marked differences were found between DC0-300 and DLC0-300. The largest DLC0-300 fibres (greater than or equal to10.7 mum) have a 320% higher frequency and a 473% higher density. Their mean diameter is, however, only 2% larger. The largest DLC0-300 fibres are not likely to be recruited by SCS, since they are not larger than their DC0-300 counterparts, they lack collaterals (which would reduce the threshold stimulus substantially) and they are more remote from the stimulation electrode.																		0006-8950			WOS:000175626900020	11960902	
J	Alo, KM; Holsheimer, J								New trends in neuromodulation for the management of neuropathic pain								NEUROSURGERY				50	4			690	703		10.1097/00006123-200204000-00003				APR 2002	2002	SINCE ITS FIRST application in 1967, the methodology and technology of spinal cord stimulation for the management of chronic, intractable pain have evolved continuously. Despite these developments and improved knowledge of the effects of spinal anatomy and epidural contact configuration on paresthesia coverage, the clinical results of spinal cord stimulation-particularly the long-term effects-are still unsatisfactory in many patients. This dissatisfaction has come primarily from the failure of single-electrode configurations to provide consistent paresthesia coverage of the entire painful area. Therefore, new approaches were developed during the late 1990s that attempted to selectively cover one or more dermatomes with paresthesia as well as to provide sequential stimulation of different anatomic sites. These approaches have been applied both intraspinally and extraspinally by stimulating either the spinal nerves or the dorsal columns. To target parts of the latter, different methods have been developed and tested using either two-dimensional contact configurations or electronic field steering. These developments hold promise for improving long-term outcomes as well as increasing the number of pain conditions that can be treated with neuromodulation therapy. In this review, the history, theoretical basis, and evolution of these methodologies, as well as the ways in which they represent new trends in neuromodulation, are discussed.																		0148-396X			WOS:000174855100004	11904018	
J	Holsheimer, J								Which neuronal elements are activated directly by spinal cord stimulation								NEUROMODULATION				5	1			25	31		10.1046/j.1525-1403.2002._2005.x				JAN 2002	2002	The purpose of this paper is to discuss which nerve fibers in the various quadrants of the spinal cord are immediately activated under normal conditions of spinal cord stimulation, ie, at voltages within the therapeutic range. The conclusions are based on both empirical and computer modeling data, The recruitment of dorsal column (DC) fibers is most likely restricted to Abeta fibers with a diameter greater than or equal to 10.7 mum in a 0.20-0.25 mm layer under the pia mater and fibers of 9.4-10.7 mum in an even smaller outer layer when a conventional SCS lead is used. In a 0.25-mm outer layer of the T11 segment the number of Abeta fibers greater than or equal to 10.7 mum, as estimated in a recent morphometric study, is about 56 in each DC. Because a DC at T11 innervates 12 dermatomes, a maximum of 4-5 fibers (greater than or equal to 10.7 mum) may be recruited in each dermatome near the discomfort threshold. The dermatome activated just below the discomfort threshold is likely to be stimulated by just a single fiber, suggesting that paresthesia and pain relief may be effected in a dermatome by the stimulation of a single large Abeta fiber. The depth of stimulation in the DCs, and thereby the number of recruited Abeta fibers, may be increased 2-3 fold when stimulation is applied by an optimized electrode configuration (a narrow bi/ tripole or a transverse tripole). Assuming that the largest Abeta fibers in a dorsal root have a diameter of 15 mum, the smallest ones recruited at discomfort threshold would be 12 mum. The latter are presumably of proprioceptive origin and responsible for segmental reflexes and uncomfortable sensations, Furthermore, it is shown to be unlikely that, apart from dorsal roots and a thin outer layer of the DCs, any other spinal structures are recruited when stimulation is applied in the dorsal epidural space. Finally, anodal excitation and anodal propagation block are unlikely to occur with SCS.																		1094-7159			WOS:000173685300005	22151778	
J	Nara, T; Saito, S; Obata, H; Goto, F								A rat model of postthoracotomy pain: behavioural and spinal cord NK-1 receptor assessment								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE				48	7			665	676		10.1007/BF03016201				JUL-AUG 2001	2001	Purpose: To develop a new rat model of postthoracotomy pain for investigating its mechanisms and clarifying neurochemical changes.Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to three groups that underwent either fourth and fifth intercostal nerve ligation, cutting of the fourth and fifth ribs, or a sham operation in which only pleura was cut. For behavioural response assessment during the following month, pinch and touch were used as mechanical stimuli, and acetone was used as a cold thermal stimulus. in addition, I-125-substance P autoradiography was used to determine neurokinin (NK) receptor density in spinal cord laminae I and II at one to six weeks after surgery.Results: In rats with nerve ligation, hypersensitivity to noxious and non-noxious stimuli continued throughout the month. The "mirror phenomenon" was observed. The lowest threshold was obtained in the dorsomedial portion of the T4 dermatome on the side of surgery. In rats with rib cutting, a lowered threshold to noxious and non-noxious stimuli was observed for two weeks. In rats with sham operations, hypersensitivity was seen only at postoperative day one. NK-I receptor density on the side of operation increased significantly in rats with nerve ligation from day seven to 28. Receptor density was highest on day 14 (22.97 +/- 1.04 fmol(.)mg(-1) tissue vs control, 16.22 +/- 0.43), representing a 50% receptor excess on the side of ligation compared to the contralateral side.Conclusion: Intercostal nerve damage induces long-term postthoracotomy pain and an increase of spinal NK-I receptors in rats. This model may be useful for investigation of postthoracotomy pain.																		0832-610X			WOS:000170588700011	11495874	
J	Cruce, WLR; Lovell, JA; Crisp, T; Stuesse, SL								Effect of aging on the substance P receptor, NK-1, in the spinal cord of rats with peripheral nerve injury								SOMATOSENSORY AND MOTOR RESEARCH				18	1			66	75						2001	2001	Substance P (SP) levels in the spinal cords of very old rats are less than the levels in younger rats (Bergman er al., 1996). After injury to a peripheral nerve in young rats, immunoreactivity (ir) to the SP receptor, NK-1 (neurokinin-1), increases in the spinal cord ipsilateral to the injury and the increases are correlated with the development of thermal hyperalgesia (Goff er al., 1998). Thus we postulated that aged rats might display an increased sensitivity to thermal stimulation before peripheral nerve injury and that they might respond differently to injury than do younger rats. To test this hypothesis, we used the Bennett and Xie model (1988) of chronic constriction injury (CCI) to the sciatic nerve to induce a neuropathic pain condition. We investigated the effect of age on changes in NK-1 ir in superficial layers of the dorsal horn and on numbers of NK ir cells in deeper laminae at the L4-L5 levels of the spinal cord after CCI. NK-1 receptors were tagged immunohistochemically and their distribution quantified by use of computer-assisted image analysis. NK-1 ir changes were related to alterations in thermal and tactile sensitivity that developed after CCI in young, mature and aged (4-6, 14-16, and 24-26 months) Fischer F344 BNF1 hybrid rats. No differences in thermal or tactile sensitivity of young and aged rats were seen in the absence of nerve injury. After injury, aged rats developed thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia more slowly than did the younger rats. NK-1 receptor ir and numbers of NK-1 ir cells in the dorsal horn increased with time post-injury in all three groups. NK-1 ir increases were correlated with the development of thermal hyperalgesia in those rats that displayed hyperalgesia. However, some rats developed an increased threshold to thermal stimuli (analgesia) and that also was correlated with increases in NK-1 ir. Thus NK-1 ir extent, while correlated with thermal sensitivity in the absence of injury, is not a specific marker for disturbances in one particular sensory modality; rather it increases with peripheral nerve injury per se.																		0899-0220	1369-1651		WOS:000168122600008	11327573	
J	Coda, BA; Brown, MC; Risler, L; Syrjala, K; Shen, DD								Equivalent analgesia and side effects during epidural and pharmacokinetically tailored intravenous infusion with matching plasma alfentanil concentration								ANESTHESIOLOGY				90	1			98	108		10.1097/00000542-199901000-00015				JAN 1999	1999	Background Recently, several clinical studies comparing intravenous and epidural infusions of fentanyl and its derivatives suggested that epidural infusions act primarily by systemic absorption to produce supraspinal analgesia. To evaluate this hypothesis, the authors used pharmacokinetically tailored intravenous infusions to produce matching plasma alfentanil concentrations during epidural and intravenous administration. The analgesia and side effects achieved with each mode of administration were compared.Methods: Twelve volunteers participated in this placebo-controlled crossover study. The pain model was cutaneous electric stimulation of the finger and toe. The test battery included subjective rating of pain intensity; end-tidal carbon dioxide level; pupil size; ratings of alertness, nausea, and pruritus; and a plasma alfentanil assay. On one test day, the participants received epidural alfentanil (400 mu g bolus + a 400-mu g/h infusion for 2 h) and an intravenous saline infusion. The test battery was administered at regular intervals. On another test day, the participants received epidural saline and a computer-controlled intravenous infusion of alfentanil. The testing protocol was repeated as on the first test day. On the day the placebo was administered, the participants received epidural and intravenous saline infusions. The order of the placebo day was randomized.Results: Plasma alfentanil concentration-time profiles were identical during epidural and intravenous infusions. A nearly equivalent analgesic response was observed with epidural and intravenous alfentanil at the upper and lower extremities. There were no differences in side effects for epidural and intravenous administration.Conclusions: The systemic redistribution of alfentanil accounts for most of the analgesia and effects produced by epidural infusion.					46th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Anesthesiologists46th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Anesthesiologists	OCT 21-25, 1995OCT 21-25, 1995	Amer Soc AnesthesiologistsAmer Soc Anesthesiologists	ATLANTA, GEORGIAATLANTA, GEORGIA										0003-3022			WOS:000077853300014	9915318	
J	Wesselink, WA; Holsheimer, J; King, GW; Torgerson, NA; Boom, HBK								Quantitative aspects of the clinical performance of transverse tripolar spinal cord stimulation								NEUROMODULATION				2	1			5	14		10.1046/j.1525-1403.1999.00005.x				JAN 1999	1999	A multicenter study was initiated to evaluate the performance of the transverse tripolar system for spinal cord stimulation. Computer modeling had predicted steering of paresthesia with a dual channel stimulator to be the main benefit of the system. The quantitative analysis presented here includes the results of 484 tests in 30 patients. For each test, paresthesia coverage as a function of voltage levels was stored in a computerized database, including a body map which enabled calculation of the degree of paresthesia coverage of separate body areas, as well as the overlap with the painful areas.The results show that with the transverse tripolar system steering of the paresthesia is possible, although optimal steering requires proper placement of the electrode with respect to the spinal cord. Therefore, with this steering ability as well as a larger therapeutic stimulation window as compared to conventional systems, we expect an increase of the long-term efficacy of spinal cord stimulation. Moreover, in view of the stimulation-induced paresthesia patterns, the system allows selective stimulation of the medial dorsal columns.																		1094-7159			WOS:000079554500002	22151057	
J	Eaton, MJ; Plunkett, JA; Karmally, S; Martinez, MA; Montanez, K								Changes in GAD- and GABA- immunoreactivity in the spinal dorsal horn after peripheral nerve injury and promotion of recovery by lumbar transplant of immortalized serotonergic precursors								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL NEUROANATOMY				16	1			57	72		10.1016/S0891-0618(98)00062-3				DEC 1998	1998	We have utilized RN46A cells, an immortalized neuronal cell line derived from E13 brainstem raphe, as a model for transplant of bioengineered serotonergic cells. RN46A cells require brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) for increased survival and serotonin (5HT) synthesis in vitro and in vivo. RN46A cells were transfected with the rat BDNF gene, and the 46A-B14 cell line was subcloned. These cells survive longer than 7 weeks after transplantation into the subarachnoid space of the lumbar spinal cord and synthesize 5HT and BDNF. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve was used to induce chronic neuropathic pain in the affected hindpaw in rats. Transplants of 46A-B14 cells placed 1 week after CCI alleviated chronic neuropathic pain, while transplants of 46A-V1 control cells, negative for 5HT and without the BDNF gene, had no effect on the induction of thermal and tactile nociception. When endogenous cells of the dorsal horn which contain the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its synthetic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) were immunohistochemically quantified in the lumbar spinal cord 3 days and 1-8 weeks after CCI, the number of GABA- and CAD-immunoreactive (ir) cells decreased bilateral to the nerve injury as soon as 3 days after CCI. At 1 week after CCI, the number of GABA-ir cells continued to significantly decline bilaterally, returning to near normal numbers on the side contralateral to the nerve injury by 8 weeks after the nerve injury. The number of GAD-ir cells began to increase bilaterally to the nerve injury at I week after CCI and continued to significantly increase in numbers over normal values by 8 weeks after the nerve injury. When examined 2 and 8 weeks after CCI plus cell transplants, the transplants of 46A-B14 cells reversed the increase in GAD-ir cell numbers and the decrease in GABA-ir cells by 1 week after transplantation, while 46A-V1 control cell transplants after CCI had no effect on the changes in numbers of GAD-ir or GABA-ir cells. Collectively, these data suggest that altered 5HT levels, and perhaps BDNF secretion, related to the transplants ameliorate chronic pain and reverse the induction and maintenance of an endogenous pain mechanism in the dorsal horn. This induction mechanism is likely dependent on altered GAD regulation and GABA synthesis, initiated by CCI.

IEEE transactions on rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society				6	3			277	85		10.1109/86.712224				1998-Sep	1998	A new type of spinal cord stimulation electrode, providing contact combinations with a transverse orientation, is presented. Electrodes were implanted in the cervical area (C4-C5) of two chronic pain patients and the stimulation results were subsequently simulated with a computer model consisting of a volume conductor model and active nerve fiber models. For various contact combinations a good match was obtained between the modeling results and the measurement data with respect to load resistance (less than 20% difference), perception thresholds (16% difference), asymmetry of paresthesia (significant correlation) and paresthesia distributions (weak correlation). The transversally oriented combinations provided the possibility to select either a preferential dorsal column stimulation, a preferential dorsal root stimulation or a mixed stimulation. The (a)symmetry of paresthesia could largely be affected in a predictable way by the selection of contact combinations as well. The transverse tripolar combination was shown to give a higher selectivity of paresthesia than monopolar and longitudinal dipolar combinations, at the cost of an increased current (more than twice).																		1063-6528			MEDLINE:9749905	9749905

These models consist of a 3-dimensional volume conductor model, representing anatomical structures and their electrical conductivities, and cable models representing the electrical behaviour of nerve fibres. The characteristics of these models and their relation to anatomy and physiology, as well as the calculation of stimulation-induced electrical fields and their effect on nerve fibre models, are reviewed. It is shown that most characteristics of SCS as predicted by computer modelling correspond well with empirical data. Accordingly, a theoretical framework describing the relations between relevant parameters in SCS is presented. Finally, it is shown how theory and computer modeling are applied to improve the efficacy of SCS by the optimization of its technique, primarily by the design of new epidural electrodes.																		1362-4393			WOS:000075136200001	9713921

The probability-of-paresthesia in 16 body segments as a function of the rostrocaudal position of the cathode was analyzed from the paresthesia coverage with 3,897 bipolar and unipolar combinations from 106 chronic pain patients.Results, The distributions of the probability-of-paresthesia in the upper and lower limb are in accordance with the hypotheses, but different distributions were found in ail trunk areas.Conclusion. The success to be expected from spinal cord stimulation in chronic pain management is inversely related to the thickness of the dorsal cerebrospinal fluid layer at the cathode level. Therefore, preoperative measurement from transverse images can be helpful as a predictor for success.																		1094-7159			WOS:000078206200006	22150980

IEEE transactions on rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society				6	2			200	7		10.1109/86.681186				1998-Jun	1998	A volume conductor model of the spinal cord and surrounding anatomical structures is used to calculate current (and current density) charge per pulse, and maximum charge density per pulse at the contact surface of the electrode in the dorsal epidural space, in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord and in the dorsal roots. The effects of various contact configurations (mono-, bi-, and tripole), contact area and spacing, pulsewidth and distance between contacts and spinal cord on these electrical parameters were investigated under conditions similar to those in clinical spinal cord stimulation. At the threshold stimulus of a large dorsal column fiber, current density and charge density per pulse at the contact surface were found to be highest (1.9.10(5) microA/cm2 and 39.1 microC/cm2.p, respectively) when the contact surface was only 0.7 mm2. When stimulating with a pulse of 500 microseconds, highest charge per pulse (0.92 microC/p), and the largest charge density per pulse in the dorsal columns (1.59 microC/cm2. p) occurred. It is concluded that of all stimulation parameters that can be selected freely, only pulsewidth affects the charge and charge density per pulse in the nervous tissue, whereas both pulsewidth and contact area strongly affect these parameters in the nonnervous tissue neighboring the electrode contacts.																		1063-6528			MEDLINE:9631328	9631328

Electrode positions, relative to the spinal cord, were estimated from computed tomographic scans. A dual-channel stimulator was used for initial percutaneous tests, and an implanted single-channel stimulator was used for follow-up test sessions. Nine "balance" settings and several cathode-anode combinations were used with the dual-channel and single-channel stimulator, respectively. In each test, the increase of paresthesia coverage from the perception threshold to the discomfort threshold was registered on a body map and the corresponding; voltages were recorded.RESULTS: Paresthesia steering occurred in all but one patient. The normalized steering score, enabling quantitative comparisons of paresthesia steering among tests and patients, showed that maximum paresthesia steering occurred when the electrode was at least 3 mm dorsal to the spinal cord and centered <2 mm from its midline. Paresthesia coverage included 70 to 100% of the body up to the electrode level, unless the electrode migrated or had broken wires. The therapeutic range, defined as the discomfort/perception of paresthesia threshold ratio, varied from 1.6 to 4.0.CONCLUSION: The clinical performance of transverse tripolar stimulation is in accordance with the characteristics predicted by computer modeling. It enables finer control of paresthesia than that achieved by polarity changes in conventional spinal cord stimulation systems.																		0148-396X			WOS:000072530300074	9526989

In ct second phase, the computer model was used for the design of new electrode configurations expected to give a better paresthesia coverage in the management of chronic pain. Two new electrode types are presented: the narrow bi-/tripole and the transverse tripole. The latter also enables adjusting the body area affected with paresthesia by means of a dual channel pulse generator giving simultaneous pulses, thereby limiting surgical interventions for electrode repositioning.																		1094-7159			WOS:000078205900003	22150882

The criteria for the geometry of the longitudinal contact array are: a low threshold for the stimulation of dorsal column fibres compared with dorsal root fibres; and a low stimulation voltage (and current). For both percutaneous and laminectomy electrodes, the contact length should be approximately 1.5 mm, and the optimum contact separation, as determined by the computer model, is 2-2.5 mm. The contacts for a laminectomy electrode should be approximately 4 mm wide. This electrode geometry is applicable to all spinal levels where the dorsal columns can be stimulated (C1-2 down to L1). The stimulating electrode should preferably be used as a tripole with one (central) cathode.																		0140-0118			WOS:000072693100008	9374053

Stimulation by two symmetrically placed electrodes connected in parallel to a single channel pulse generator may give similar results, because of their generally smaller distance from the spinal cord, but a ''summation effect'' does not exist. A smaller dorsal column area is activated when two offset electrodes are used. An electrode placed laterally or transverse bipolar stimulation results in unilateral, usually segmentary, paresthesia.CONCLUSIONS: The relative positions of cathodes and anodes and their distance from the spinal cord are the major determinants of dorsal column/dorsal root activation and paresthesia distribution. The large interpatient variability of the intraspinal geometry is the main cause of differences in paresthesia coverage among patients having optimally placed electrode(s). Changes of paresthesia coverage over time are more probable when multiple electrodes are used.																		0148-396X			WOS:A1997XU97200082	9310984

The authors extended these preclinical studies to human volunteers by examining the concentration-dependent effects of intravenous lidocaine on acute sensory thresholds and facilitated processing induced by intradermal capsaicin.Methods: Fifteen healthy persons received a lidocaine or a placebo infusion, A computer-controlled infusion pump targeted sequential stepwise increases in plasma lidocaine concentration steps of 1, 2, and 3 mu g/ml. At each plasma concentration, neurosensory testing (thermal and von Frey hair test stimulation) were performed. After completing the tests at the 3 mu g/ml plasma lidocaine level, intradermal capsaicin was injected into the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the flare response and hyperalgesia to von Frey hair stimulation, stroking, and heat mas assessed.Results: The continuous infusion of lidocaine and placebo had no significant effect on any stimulus threshold. Although intravenous Lidocaine resulted in a decrease in all secondary hyperalgesia responses, this was only significant for heat hyperalgesia. Intravenous lidocaine resulted in a significant decrease in the flare response induced by intradermal capsaicin.Conclusions: These studies suggest that the facilitated state induced by persistent small afferent input human pain models may predict the activity of agents that affect components of nociceptive processing that are different from those associated with time pain stale evoked by ''acute'' thermal or mechanical stimuli. Such insight may be variable in the efficient development of novel analgesics for both neuropathic and post-tissue-injury pain states.																		0003-3022			WOS:A1997XE80600006	9197294

The aim of this study is to analyze the origin of this problem and to provide solutions.METHODS: Results from theoretical studies, in which a computer model was used to mimic the effects of SCS on spinal nerve fibers, were used to analyze which factors may limit paresthesia coverage. Model predictions were verified by empirical data from clinical literature.RESULTS: When using common SCS electrodes, both perception threshold and motor/discomfort threshold are generally related to dorsal root stimulation, Because these thresholds have a small ratio (similar to 1:1.4), stimulation of dorsal column fibers and paresthesia coverage is limited by this small range of stimulation. When the distance between the epidural electrode and spinal cord is large (midthoracically), the threshold for dorsal column stimulation exceeds discomfort threshold, resulting only in segmental paresthesia. The range of dorsal column stimulation and paresthesia coverage can be improved when using either an optimally dimensioned rostrocaudal bi-/tripole or a transverse tripole (''guarded cathode''). When applying the latter in combination with a dual channel pulse generator providing simultaneous pulses, paresthesias can simply be changed to optimally cover the painful area.CONCLUSION: Paresthesia coverage and pain management by SCS can be improved when using electrodes as proposed.																		0148-396X			WOS:A1997WX02300025	9149258

Neurosurgical focus				2	1			e1	e1						1997-Jan-15	1997	Artificial neural networks are used increasingly in applications such as graphic pattern recognition, which are difficult to address with conventional statistical methods. In the management of chronic pain, graphic methods are used routinely; patients describe their patterns of pain using "pain drawings." The authors have previously reported an automated, computerized pain drawing methodology, which has been used by patients with implanted spinal cord stimulators to represent a technical goal of the procedure, the overlap of pain by stimulation paresthesias. Standard linear discriminant statistical methods have shown associations between stimulation parameters and electrode positions as independent variables and technical outcome and relief of pain as dependent variables. The authors have applied artificial neural networks to the problem of optimizing implanted stimulator adjustment. A data set of 3000 electrode combinations obtained in 41 patients was used to develop a linear discriminant statistical model on a mainframe computer and to train artificial neural networks on a personal computer. The performance of these two systems on a new data set obtained in 10 patients was compared with that of human "experts." The best neural network model was marginally better than the linear discriminant model; the variance in patient ratings was predicted by these models to a degree that the human experts were unable to predict. The authors anticipate expanding the role of these models and incorporating them into expert systems for clinical use.																			1092-0684		MEDLINE:15096022	15096022	
J	Struijk, JJ; Holsheimer, J								Transverse tripolar spinal cord stimulation: Theoretical performance of a dual channel system								MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING				34	4			273	279		10.1007/BF02511237				JUL 1996	1996	A new approach to spinal cord stimulation is presented, by which several serious problems of conventional methods can be solved. A transverse tripolar electrode with a dual-channel voltage stimulator is evaluated theoretically by means of a volume conductor model, combined with nerve fibre models. The simulations predict that a high degree of freedom in the control of activation of dorsal spinal pathways may be obtained with the described system. This implies an easier control of paraesthesia coverage of skin areas and the possibility to correct undesired paraesthesia patterns, caused by lead migration, tissue growth, or anatomical asymmetries, for example, without surgical intervention. It will also be possible to preferentially activate either dorsal column or dorsal root fibres, which has some important clinical advantages. Compared to conventional stimulation systems, the new system has a relatively high current drain.																		0140-0118			WOS:A1996VB82700009	8935492	
J	HOLSHEIMER, J; STRUIJK, JJ; TAS, NR								EFFECTS OF ELECTRODE GEOMETRY AND COMBINATION ON NERVE-FIBER SELECTIVITY IN SPINAL-CORD STIMULATION								MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING				33	5			676	682		10.1007/BF02510785				SEP 1995	1995	The differential effects of the geometry of a rostrocaudal array of electrode contacts on dorsal column fibre and dorsal root fibre activation in spinal cord stimulation are analysed theoretically. 3-D models of the mid-cervical and mid-thoracic vertebral areas are used for the computation of stimulation induced field potentials, whereas a cable model of myelinated nerve fibre is used for the calculation of the excitation thresholds of large dorsal column and dorsal root fibres. The size and spacing of 2-D rectangular electrode contacts are varied while mono-, bi- and tripolar stimulation are applied. The model predicts that the highest preferential stimulation of dorsal root fibres is obtained in monopolar stimulation with a large cathode, whereas dorsal column fibre preference is highest in tripolar stimulation with small contacts and small contact spacings. Fibre type preference is most sensitive to variations of rostrocaudal contact size and least sensitive to variations of lateral contact size. Dorsal root fibre preference is increased and sensitivity to lead geometry is reduced as the distance from contacts to spinal cord is increased.																		0140-0118	1741-0444		WOS:A1995RY75500007	8523909	
J	Holsheimer, J; Barolat, G; Struijk, J J; He, J								Significance of the spinal cord position in spinal cord stimulation.								Acta neurochirurgica. Supplement				64				119	24						1995	1995	The effects of the antero-posterior and medio-lateral positions of the spinal cord in the dural sac on the perception threshold and paresthesia coverage in spinal cord stimulation were analyzed. The distributions of the dorsal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) layer thickness, measured from transverse MR scans of normal subjects at various spinal levels, were used to calculate the distributions of threshold voltages for the stimulation of spinal nerve fibers by a computer model. These theoretical threshold distributions were shown to fit well to the corresponding distributions of perception threshold measured in patients. It is concluded that the thickness of the dorsal csf layer is the main factor determining the perception threshold and paresthesia coverage in spinal cord stimulation: an increasing thickness raises the threshold and reduces the coverage, and vice versa. The effects of an asymmetrical electrode position with respect to the spinal cord midline were also analyzed by computer modeling. It is concluded that a lateral asymmetry of less than 1 mm gives a significant reduction of perception threshold and may result in unilateral paresthesiae.																		0065-1419			MEDLINE:8748598	8748598	
J	MAO, J; MAYER, DJ; HAYES, RL; PRICE, DD								SPATIAL PATTERNS OF INCREASED SPINAL-CORD MEMBRANE-BOUND PROTEIN-KINASE-C AND THEIR RELATION TO INCREASES IN C-14 2-DEOXYGLUCOSE METABOLIC-ACTIVITY IN RATS WITH PAINFUL PERIPHERAL MONONEUROPATHY								JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				70	2			470	481		10.1152/jn.1993.70.2.470				AUG 1993	1993	1. Three-dimensional spatial patterns of changes in membrane-bound protein kinase C (PKC) were examined in the lumbar spinal cords (L1-L5) of rats with an experimental painful peripheral mononeuropathy. Painful peripheral mononeuropathy was produced by loosely ligating the rat's common sciatic nerve, resulting in chronic constrictive nerve injury (CCI). Changes in spinal cord membrane-bound PKC distribution were assayed by employing an established quantitative [H-3]-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate ([H-3] PDBu) autoradiographic assay, which includes spinal cord sectioning, incubation of spinal cord sections with [H-3]-PDBu, production of autoradiographs, and computer-assisted image processing.2. Sciatic nerve ligation induced demonstrable thermal hyperalgesia in response to radiant heat stimulation and spontaneous pain-related behaviors (such as lifting of the nerve-ligated hind paw) in CCI rats 3, 7, and 10 days after unilateral sciatic nerve ligation.3. Consistent with behavioral changes, CCI rats examined 3 or 10 days after sciatic nerve ligation displayed a three-dimensional pattern of increased membrane-bound PKC in the lumbar spinal cord (L1-L5) strikingly different from that of sham-operated rats: in the dorsoventral dimension, reliable increases in membrane-bound PKC occurred mainly within spinal cord laminae I-IV and V-VI in CCI rats; in the ipsilateral-contralateral dimension, changes in membrane-bound PKC were seen on both sides of the spinal cord in CCI rats with reliably higher levels of membrane-bound PKC on the side ipsilateral than on the side contralateral to sciatic nerve ligation; in the rostrocaudal dimension, increases in membrane-bound PKC in the spinal cord dorsal horns of CCI rats extended from spinal segments L2-L5.4. Both three-dimensional increases in spinal cord membrane-bound PKC and nociceptive behaviors (thermal hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain behaviors) in CCI rats were reliably reduced after three daily intrathecal treatments with 80 nmol GM1 ganglioside (a glycosphingolipid shown to prevent PKC translocation/activation), the first of which was given 1 h after sciatic nerve ligation. This reduction was seen 24 h but not 7 days after the last GM1 ganglioside treatment.5. This three-dimensional increase in membrane-bound PKC in the spinal cord dorsal horn of CCI rats displayed high correlations with thermal hyperalgesia and with spontaneous pain-related behaviors in CCI rats observed both 3 and 10 days after sciatic nerve ligation. Similar correlations were observed between decreases in levels of membrane-bound PKC in the spinal cord dorsal horn and the attenuation of nociceptive behaviors in CCI rats after three daily intrathecal treatments with GM1 ganglioside.6. Interestingly, the present three-dimensional spatial pattern of increases in membrane-bound PKC showed similarities to as well as differences from that of elevations in spinal cord neural activity inferred from our previous C-14-2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) metabolic mapping study utilizing this same CCI model. In both cases, increases in membrane-bound PKC or 2-DG metabolic activity occur bilaterally and extend rostrocaudally within the sampled lumbar spinal cord of CCI rats, and both increases are attenuated by GM1 ganglioside treatment. However, unlike peak increases in 2-DG metabolic activity within the deep dorsal horn (laminae V-VI) and the ventral horn (laminae VII), and extensive rostrocaudal extension (from L1 to L5) of increased 2-DG metabolic activity in CCI rats, peak increases in membrane-bound PKC occurred in the superficial dorsal horn (laminae I-II) of CCI rats. The rostrocaudal spread of such increases was largely restricted to L3 and L4 spinal segments.7. Comparisons of spatial patterns between changes in membrane-bound PKC and 2-DG metabolic activity (thereby neural activity) led us to suggest the presence of two populations of spinal cord neurons showing increases in neural activity in this CCI model: 1) neurons within the superficial laminae (laminae I-II), which are directly associated with PKC-mediated intracellular changes and subsequent increases in neural activity, and 2) neurons within the deep dorsal horn (laminae V-VI) and the ventral horn (laminae VII), which are likely to be influenced by PKC-mediated intracellular changes occurring in groups of neurons within more superficial dorsal horn laminae through intrinsic spinal cord connections.8. The results indicate that peripheral nerve injury in this CCI model induces three-dimensional increases in spinal cord membrane-bound PKC that are temporally con-elated with demonstrable thermal hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain behaviors and are spatially associated with increases in spinal cord 2-DG metabolic activity. Because GM1 ganglioside, an intracellular inhibitor of PKC translocation/activation, reduces levels of membrane-bound PKC, nociceptive behaviors, and 2-DG metabolic activity (from our previous study), the present results suggest possible causal relationships between PKC translocation, increased neural activity, and pain-related behaviors after CCI. Because PKC translocation/activation has been associated with CNS neuronal plastic changes, mechanisms underlying postinjury neuropathic pain may be mediated by CNS neuronal plasticity resulting from an increase in membrane-bound PKC.																		0022-3077	1522-1598		WOS:A1993LU33100002	8410149
