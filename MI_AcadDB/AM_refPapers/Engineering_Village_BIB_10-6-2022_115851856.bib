abstract = {The production of complex functional structures becomes possible using Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology. Topology optimization allows to obtain lightweight and high-performance parts. In this study, the combining of topology optimization with additive manufacturing is proposed. This combination is mainly motivated by two principal reasons. Firstly, topology optimization generates complex structures that cannot be achieved by conventional processes. Secondly, a great flexibility in part design is provided by additive manufacturing. Indeed, an automated algorithm for the topology optimization of structures obtained by additive manufacturing is presented. The proposed methodology is based on the generation of the geometry and the mesh of the studied structure using ANSYS software that uses finite element analysis (FEA). Then, the topology optimization algorithm is implemented in MATLAB. The developed algorithm is illustrated by a numerical example involving the minimization of the compliance of 3D beam structure.},

The first example is a frequency dependent dual focusing lens design through topology optimization, using two different dielectric filaments. The second is a compressed Luneburg lens that theoretically requires a continuous permittivity gradient from 7.8 in its centre down to 1 on the surface, and is realised by printing with a total of five different dielectrics.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Objective: Large-scale integral titanium alloy structural parts have been used as an indicator to measure the technological advancement of defense equipment. Laser additive manufacturing technology, with its unique advantages, has gradually become one of the processing methods for large-scale integral titanium alloys. In laser additive manufacturing, formed parts are circularly heated by a focused and high-energy laser beam. A large temperature gradient will be established in the formed parts, resulting in complex stress and strain evolution during the forming process. After forming, enormous residual stress is generated inside the formed elements, causing the substrate to warp significantly. This problem has been one of the factors impeding the development of this technology. Many scholars have found that the method of subfield scanning can effectively control the internal stress during additive manufacturing of large-scale components. However, the layer configuration of the large frame structure is relatively complicated. It is necessary to consider the appropriate means for planning the scanning trajectory and jump sequence according to the structural characteristics of large-scale frame structures. Methods: To mitigate the deformation and cracking of formed parts in laser additive manufacturing due to uneven temperature distribution, a subfield scanning strategy based on characteristic regions was proposed. This study focused on two aspects: scanning starting point positions and jump strategy between characteristic regions. First, ANSYS was used to simulate two kinds of characteristic regions' deposition manufacturing processes, including the L-shaped and T-shaped regions. The influences of the ipsilateral side starting point scanning and the opposite side starting point scanning on the temperature field distribution of characteristic regions and the thermal cycle of substrates' nodes were analyzed. The best scanning starting points for the two characteristic regions were identified. After that, the frame structures' deposition manufacturing processes were simulated using three jump scanning strategies: continuous jump, interval jump, and maximum span jump. The temperature distribution nephograms of the frame structures under the three jump scanning strategies were obtained. Second, temperature field simulation results were loaded on stress analysis models to analyze the stress evolution process. Finally, the thermocouple's temperature variations of substrates' nodes during the deposition processes were monitored, and substrate deformation after deposition was measured. The experimental and simulation results were analyzed. Results and Discussions: The above research shows that changing the scanning start points will affect the L-shaped and T-shaped characteristic regions' temperature distribution. When using opposite side starting points to deposit characteristic regions, the influence range of temperature can be reduced; the cumulative heat effect can be reduced (Fig. 3), thereby decreasing thermal behavior's influence during the deposition process on the substrate's mechanical properties. In addition, when using opposite side starting points to deposit characteristic regions, the substrate's nodal thermal cycle curve rises slowly, and the node's peak temperature is also low (Fig. 4). When the frame structure's deposition is only completed, the maximum temperature of the molten pool with the maximum span jump scanning is lower than the interval jump scanning and continuous jump scanning (Fig. 7). During the deposition process, the three jump strategies' stresses are distributed in the characteristic region, where the scan starts, and the characteristic regions' junctions. The phenomenon of stress concentration becomes more visible as the deposition layer's height increases (Fig. 8). The deposited layer's stress distribution range does not change much after cooling; the substrate's high-stress area gathers to the constrained position, concentrated on both sides of the constrained end. The stress at maximum span jump scanning is lower than that at interval jump scanning and continuous jump scanning (Fig. 9). Conclusions: Following the above analysis, this article proposed a subfield scanning strategy based on characteristic regions for the large frame structure, classified according to its organizational characteristics. It is divided into two characteristic regions: T-shaped and L-shaped regions. The effects of scanning start point positions and character regions' jump scanning strategy on thermal behavior and stress evolution during the scanning process were investigated using theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The simulation results were tested and verified through thermocouple temperature measurement and substrate warping deformation experiments. The results of the investigation agree with the simulation results. Studies have shown that the maximum span jump scanning strategy based on the characteristic regions can make the substrate's temperature distribution more uniform during the deposition manufacturing process, resulting in less stress and deformation of the formed parts. Discrete control of thermal stress is realized to reduce the macroscopic deformation and cracking of the formed parts. This study serves as a theoretical basis and method guidance for improving the forming quality of large-scale integral titanium alloy structural parts.<br/></div> &copy; 2021, Chinese Lasers Press.

In the present work, a finite element model for simulating transient heat transfer in such processes has been implemented using the ANSYS software, and the temperature and stress distributions related to 316L stainless steel thin-walled ring parts have been simulated and analyzed. The effect of the laser power, scanning speed, and scanning mode on temperature distribution, molten pool structure, deformation, and stress field has been studied. The simulation results show that the peak temperature, weld pool size, deformation, and residual stress increase with an increase in laser power and a decrease in the scanning speed. The scanning mode has no obvious effect on temperature distribution, deformation, and residual stress. In addition, a forming experiment was carried out. The experimental results show that the samples prepared by laser power P = 800 W, V = 6 mm/s, and the normal scanning method display good quality, whereas the samples prepared under other parameters have obvious defects.

Recent advances in additive manufacturing have enabled the manufacturing of complex geometries enabling the potential for higher efficiencies for smaller, more compact designs. The aviation sector is a critical aspect of the transition to electrical population and one that cannot be proactively solved with traditional electric motors. To this end, the use of a superconducting electric motors has been proposed to achieve higher efficiencies and make application within aircraft a viable alternative. The investigation of a cryocooling component, specifically, the ability to pump cryogenic fluid through the electrical systems to maintain the superconducting state is critical to determine the viability of such a design. This paper considers the application of a warm pump in combination with a recuperative heat exchanger to fulfil the cryogenic circulation requirement. The utilisation of additive manufacturing to design complex geometries and ANSYS fluent to verify the effectiveness of the design can result in a superior solution. This paper proposes the use of homogenised heat transfer within the design to achieve both a room temperature output and a cryogenic output. To achieve this, two critical design requirements were proposed; a low thermally conductive intermediate layer to ensure controlled homogenised heat transfer and fixed temperature inlets, one being room temperature and the other at cryogenic temperature. The high temperature gradient across the recuperative heat exchanger, in combination with a low thermally conductive intermediate layer allows for an even heat transfer cumulating in the reversal of the inlet temperatures at an efficiency between 95 and 98 percent.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

A 3D finite element model has been developed using Mechanical Advanced Parametric Design Language of Ansys&reg; software. A reduced current heat-input strategy has been adopted, i.e. the current is reduced for every next layer until the fourth layer. It is repeated for the next set of four layers. The effect of the proposed framework has been studied on the single-track eight-layered thin wall geometry. Further, experiments have been performed to validate the developed model. A good agreement has been found between predicted and experimental results. Moreover, the developed framework has been found as an effective strategy to control the evolution of accumulated heat and distortion in the substrate.

abstract = {X-ray computed tomography is a powerful tool to nondestructively inspect additively manufactured parts. Additive manufacturing of metals, especially laser powder bed fusion, is increasingly being adopted for serial production of critical components in aerospace, automotive and various other industries. The technology holds huge potential for more efficient material usage and light weighting of components, among the many advantages. As this new production method is being ramped up and refined in various industry sectors, X-ray tomography is critical to the advancement of the quality of the produced components. X-ray tomography allows the nondestructive evaluation of the structural integrity of the parts produced, which in turn provides confidence in the expected performance of the parts. Besides final inspection of parts for porosity/defects and dimensional tolerances for a pass/fail decision, X-ray tomography also has a critical role to play in advancing and improving the additive manufacturing processes. This process improvement refers to the inspection of small representative coupon samples on a microscopic scale, in order to optimize the process parameters such as laser power, speed, scan strategy and various others. In this work, we describe the evaluation of small solid cube coupon samples and lattice structure coupon samples. These examples are meant to improve the understanding of the potential of X-ray tomography in advancing additive manufacturing processes (in contrast to its usual use for nondestructive testing of final parts), thereby providing support towards qualification of these processes and the parts produced in these processes. X-ray tomography, therefore, plays a key role in the adoption and qualification of high-quality metal additive manufacturing. &#169; 2022 Royal Microscopical Society.},

abstract = {        <b>Objective</b> Large-scale integral titanium alloy structural parts have been used as an indicator to measure the technological advancement of defense equipment. Laser additive manufacturing technology, with its unique advantages, has gradually become one of the processing methods for large-scale integral titanium alloys. In laser additive manufacturing, formed parts are circularly heated by a focused and high-energy laser beam. A large temperature gradient will be established in the formed parts, resulting in complex stress and strain evolution during the forming process. After forming, enormous residual stress is generated inside the formed elements, causing the substrate to warp significantly. This problem has been one of the factors impeding the development of this technology. Many scholars have found that the method of subfield scanning can effectively control the internal stress during additive manufacturing of large-scale components. However, the layer configuration of the large frame structure is relatively complicated. It is necessary to consider the appropriate means for planning the scanning trajectory and jump sequence according to the structural characteristics of large-scale frame structures. <b>Methods</b> To mitigate the deformation and cracking of formed parts in laser additive manufacturing due to uneven temperature distribution, a subfield scanning strategy based on characteristic regions was proposed. This study focused on two aspects: scanning starting point positions and jump strategy between characteristic regions. First, ANSYS was used to simulate two kinds of characteristic regions' deposition manufacturing processes, including the L-shaped and T-shaped regions. The influences of the ipsilateral side starting point scanning and the opposite side starting point scanning on the temperature field distribution of characteristic regions and the thermal cycle of substrates' nodes were analyzed. The best scanning starting points for the two characteristic regions were identified. After that, the frame structures' deposition manufacturing processes were simulated using three jump scanning strategies: continuous jump, interval jump, and maximum span jump. The temperature distribution nephograms of the frame structures under the three jump scanning strategies were obtained. Second, temperature field simulation results were loaded on stress analysis models to analyze the stress evolution process. Finally, the thermocouple's temperature variations of substrates' nodes during the deposition processes were monitored, and substrate deformation after deposition was measured. The experimental and simulation results were analyzed. <b>Results and Discussions</b> The above research shows that changing the scanning start points will affect the L-shaped and T-shaped characteristic regions' temperature distribution. When using opposite side starting points to deposit characteristic regions, the influence range of temperature can be reduced; the cumulative heat effect can be reduced (Fig. 3), thereby decreasing thermal behavior's influence during the deposition process on the substrate's mechanical properties. In addition, when using opposite side starting points to deposit characteristic regions, the substrate's nodal thermal cycle curve rises slowly, and the node's peak temperature is also low (Fig. 4). When the frame structure's deposition is only completed, the maximum temperature of the molten pool with the maximum span jump scanning is lower than the interval jump scanning and continuous jump scanning (Fig. 7). During the deposition process, the three jump strategies' stresses are distributed in the characteristic region, where the scan starts, and the characteristic regions' junctions. The phenomenon of stress concentration becomes more visible as the deposition layer's height increases (Fig. 8). The deposited layer's stress distribution range does not change much after cooling; the substrate's high-stress area gathers to the constrained position, concentrated on both sides of the constrained end. The stress at maximum span jump scanning is lower than that at interval jump scanning and continuous jump scanning (Fig. 9). <b>Conclusions</b> Following the above analysis, this article proposed a subfield scanning strategy based on characteristic regions for the large frame structure, classified according to its organizational characteristics. It is divided into two characteristic regions: T-shaped and L-shaped regions. The effects of scanning start point positions and character regions' jump scanning strategy on thermal behavior and stress evolution during the scanning process were investigated using theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The simulation results were tested and verified through thermocouple temperature measurement and substrate warping deformation experiments. The results of the investigation agree with the simulation results. Studies have shown that the maximum span jump scanning strategy based on the characteristic regions can make the substrate's temperature distribution more uniform during the deposition manufacturing process, resulting in less stress and deformation of the formed parts. Discrete control of thermal stress is realized to reduce the macroscopic deformation and cracking of the formed parts. This study serves as a theoretical basis and method guidance for improving the forming quality of large-scale integral titanium alloy structural parts.},

The use of conventional piezoelectric buzzers allows us to reduce fabrication costs. The working or mobile platform is the base for objects that will be manipulated, for example, in automated assembling. The micropositioner can be integrated into a microgripper to generate a complete manipulation system. For micropositioner fabrication, at first, Polylactic Acid (PLA) was chosen as the structural material, but after simulation and some experimental tests performed with a micropositioner made of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), it showed larger displacement (approx. 20%) due to its lower stiffness. A third test was performed with a positioner made with Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG), obtaining an intermediate performance. The originality of this work resides in the geometrical arrangement based on thermoplastic polymer compliance mechanisms, as well as in the use of additive manufacturing to fabricate it. An experimental setup was developed to carry out experimental tests. ANSYS&#8482; was used for simulation.},

abstract = {Formula Student represents the main motorsport activity for future professionals during their academic preparation. There is intensive migration from the prototypes with an internal combustion engine to electrical vehicles. The challenge of electric vehicles is the weight of the batteries which has to be compensated. The Topological Optimization process represents a method of removing volume and mass of the component (elements of mesh) with the aid of the discretization allowed by the finite element method (FEM) until a mass or stress constraint is attained. The results come in a complex shape, the material being kept only in the stressstrain directions. The manufacturing process is usually as complex, being employed high complexity technologies such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Improved strength-to-weight ratio materials are to be considered to obtain the most performant design of a specific component. The present paper presents the topological optimization process of the steering knuckle for the Formula Student electric vehicle of ART-TU Team of Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. It means that the part is simulated and optimized through Ansys Static Structural and there is done post-processing of the component along with Data Validation. The conclusions consist of the viability of the Topological Optimization process when designing complex components for performance automotive.},

abstract = {In this work, we have developed a computational probabilistic method to quantify the permanent (non-zero strain) continuum/material deformation. Different from physical-based modeling, the method developed here is based on a data-driven statistics approach, which solves the problem without needing the information of physical deformation process. The proposed method relies only on the scanned material data from the thermal distorted configuration as well as the shape of the initial design configuration. We coined this artificial intelligence based algorithm as the <i>material </i><i>deformation </i><i>finding</i> (MDF) algorithm. In this work, the MDF algorithm was first validated by a 2D synthetic example. We then demonstrated that the proposed MDF method can accurately find the permanent thermal distortion of a complex 3D printed structural component, and hence to identify the thermal compensation design configuration. The results obtained in this work indicate that one can use this data-driven statistics approach to significantly mitigate thermal distortion of 3D printed products in additive manufacturing.
